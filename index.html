		<p class="lead">A dingy fleece blanket is draped over the fish tank to keep the kids from watching TV in the reflection of the glass when they are supposed to fall asleep.</p>
		<p>At bedtime, the four oldest &mdash; Jaquan, Matthew, Jazmine and DeArShay &mdash; take the blankets and pillows stuffed in the shelves beside the motel bed and lie on dirty, torn carpet. They have bedbug bites on their arms and legs.</p>
		<p>Their mother will pick the black insects off their skin in the morning. She squeezes them and they pop.</p>
		<p>The children&rsquo;s parents, who sleep in the queen-size bed with 2-year-old Jamisha and 3-year-old Jonathan Jr., tell the older kids to roll toward the wall and the fish tank, to turn their backs to the television when it&rsquo;s time to sleep.</p>
		<p>A skinny yellow tabby named Barack finds an open spot to curl up in this room at the King&rsquo;s Inn, which is the farthest thing from any place anyone royal would sleep. The screen on the window is torn along the bottom, a cloth tacked up as a lone curtain for privacy. The parking lot where the kids play is strewn with Doritos bags, empty pop cans and cigarette butts.</p>
		<p>It is from this Aurora motel room that three of Peggy Monroe&rsquo;s six children walk to school each morning.</p>
		<p>The family of eight has lived here for 10 months.</p>
		<p>The children are homeless under federal education law. The three oldest are among the 23,300 homeless children attending Colorado schools, and that&rsquo;s not counting homeless babies and preschoolers, or the children who move from town to town with their families and don&rsquo;t go to school.</p>

		<p class="splainer">The number of homeless school children in this state has more than tripled in a decade. Some live in cars, campgrounds and shelters, but most double up with other families or live in cheap motels because they&rsquo;ve lost their own housing.</p>

		<p class="lead">The Cartoon Network is blaring one April afternoon and Peggy is in the center of the bed eating toast and grape jelly, surrounded by two kids in underwear and one in diapers. The children&rsquo;s feet are black from running around barefoot on the parking lot asphalt and along the cement walkway that rings the King&rsquo;s Inn and passes under the paint-chipped staircases that connect four stories of destitution.</p>
		<p>Jonathan Jr., &ldquo;Jay-Jay&rdquo; for short, jumps on Peggy, spilling jelly on the bed. She slaps his hand.</p>
		<p>DeArShay, or &ldquo;Shay-Shay&rdquo;, then 4, darts out of the room into the parking lot. &ldquo;Shay, you don&rsquo;t have no pants on! Get your butt in the house,&rdquo; Peggy yells. Shay-Shay is always in trouble, it seems. She is too young for kindergarten and wasn&rsquo;t signed up for preschool, so she spends her days competing for attention with her younger brother and sister.</p>
		<p>She loses.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m ready to get out of here,&rdquo; Peggy says, her patience dwindling after so many months of living with six kids in a motel room. She is wearing her hot-pink Tinkerbell T-shirt, a long, dark braid all the way down to her yellow corduroys.</p>
		<p>She gets off the bed and finds her sneakers so she can walk west on East Colfax Avenue toward Kenton Elementary School. The younger kids stay with Jonathan &ldquo;Johnny&rdquo; Jacko, Peggy&rsquo;s boyfriend and father of her two youngest.</p>

		<p>Peggy used to let the kids walk the mile home alone but a caseworker sent by child protection services told her they weren&rsquo;t old enough to walk along Colfax by themselves. Still, sometimes Peggy can&rsquo;t make it. The family has no car. Every grocery trip, housing appointment or school event requires toting kids along one of the city&rsquo;s busiest streets or climbing on public buses.</p>
		<p>The caseworker also said the kids need more baths, shouldn&rsquo;t go outside the motel room in their underwear and that Peggy and Johnny should stop smoking medical marijuana.</p>
		<p>The caseworker wants them to move to a &ldquo;more stable&rdquo; place to live. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m working on getting us out of here,&rdquo; Peggy says. &ldquo;The bedbugs. The roaches. It&rsquo;s so hot in the room. It&rsquo;s too small. I want my kids to have their own rooms back.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The school helped her apply for a subsidized apartment and she is waiting to find out whether they&rsquo;re accepted. If they are, though, the kids will start at yet another school; the apartment complex is outside Aurora Public Schools.</p>
		<p>Peggy hates that part. The kids began at Kenton in the spring of 2013, and this is the first time they have attended the same school for more than one year.</p>
		<p>Jaquan, 9, who started fourth grade this year, has attended at least one new school every year since kindergarten. He is falling behind.</p>

		<p class="splainer">Each year, one in three homeless students in Colorado switches schools at least once, according to state Department of Education data. It takes a child four to six months to regain the academic ground lost by one move, said researchers from Loyola University. Children who are homeless are eight times more likely to suffer abuse and neglect than other children.</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">An unexpected visit</h3>

		<p class="lead">On their walk home from school each day, Jaquan, Matthew and Jazmine pass a convenience store with bars on the windows, a pawn shop and a rundown apartment complex where men hang out in the parking lot during the day.</p>
		<p>A spring breeze is picking up on a May school day when the bell rings and releases hordes of kids into the hallways, but the Monroe kids were dismissed early because it&rsquo;s &ldquo;Totes of Hope Day.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s when needy children, including many who are homeless, are called out of class a few minutes early so teachers and staff can give them plastic bags of donated food. There are cans of beans, macaroni with meat sauce and breakfast bars.</p>

		<p>Jazmine struggles to put her bag in her backpack, sending cans rolling in opposite directions on the sidewalk in front of the school. Her brothers grow impatient as she chases cans and crams them in her backpack.</p>
		<p>Halfway home, Matthew&rsquo;s plastic bag splits open. He stuffs as much as he can in his pockets. The boy has a can in one hand and a bag of ramen noodles in the other. He opens a cereal bar and eats while he walks, stopping once to hide inside the trunk of a giant oak tree.</p>
		<p>School officials, including the truancy officer, have visited the family&rsquo;s first-floor motel room four times since last spring. When the kids started at Kenton, teachers were worried about their dirty clothes and bodies, and wondered why they were missing school so often.</p>
		<p>The kids arrive at the motel and find their mom in the middle of the bed, braiding the younger kids&rsquo; hair and watching Kathie Lee Gifford on TV.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I only got two more and then I&rsquo;m done,&rdquo; Peggy shouts at Jay-Jay, who has started to wriggle off the bed. Jay is potty-training; he shakes in fear when he pees his pants because he knows he&rsquo;s about to get in trouble.</p>
		<p>Peggy shows off the purple-and-white outfits she bought for the family to wear to the Colorado Rockies baseball game this weekend.</p>
		<p>They&rsquo;ve never been before and bought the tickets through the school for $3 apiece. The excitement over the new clothes is cut short when Yolanda Ramalho, the caseworker sent by child protective services, shows up unexpectedly.</p>
		<p>Child welfare authorities received a complaint the parents were yelling and what Peggy calls &ldquo;false allegations of domestic violence.&rdquo; The caseworker was sent to help teach them parenting skills.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;There is nothing we do to these kids. There are no marks on them, unless they fall and scrape their knees,&rdquo; Peggy says.</p>
		<p>But Shay-Shay has a chipped front tooth. She says it happened when she was kicked out of bed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s bothering me sometimes.&rdquo; Jamisha is toddling around in a saggy diaper, chocolate all over her face from a frosted doughnut.</p>
		<p>Peggy loves her kids, and she insists she is doing her best to raise them under these circumstances. If she is awake, she is working &mdash; doing laundry, grocery shopping and, if she has money left, buying new shoes or pants for the kids. &ldquo;I want them to have it better than me,&rdquo; she says.</p>

		<p>Johnny is exasperated. The kids, especially Shay-Shay, don&rsquo;t listen to him, he complains. &ldquo;I deal with them all day, every day,&rdquo; he tells the caseworker. &ldquo;You take them home with you one day and then we&rsquo;ll talk.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;I want to move,&rdquo; says the oldest child in this family, standing outside the motel room door holding a soccer ball that he has been kicking across the parking lot to another boy who also lives here. Jaquan is a quiet boy with long eyelashes and bright eyes that charm his teachers, and, sometimes, his mom.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I want to be a football player,&rdquo; he says. This summer, though, he went to summer school with his younger brother Matthew, 7. Jaquan is below grade level in reading and math, and Jazmine, 6, is behind in every subject. Matthew brought his scores up to grade level after summer school, in time to start second grade.</p>
		<p>At Kenton, a few weeks before the regular school year ended, Jaquan was curled over a paper on how to help the earth. &ldquo;I would pick up all the trash cans and paper,&rdquo; he scrawled, staying behind to finish his sentence while his class lined up.</p>
		<p>Like most days, he wore his light-blue shirt, khaki pants and red high tops. The school provides school uniforms for needy children who attend Kenton, where 88 percent of students qualify for free lunch.</p>
		<p>Jazmine, who started first grade this school year, has her own special-education plan because of a learning disability.</p>

		<p>Peggy&rsquo;s arms are toned from the labor she is assigned when she goes to a temporary agency, jobs such as mopping offices for eight hours or washing windows. She can flip from sweet to angry in a split second when a kid accidentally hits her in the face with hair beads after lunging in for a hug. She has gotten a federal disability check each month since soon after high school because of learning disabilities.</p>
		<p>Johnny is outgoing and friendly but often exasperated by living in the motel. He shaves his head, and can spend an hour polishing the numerous silver necklaces and rings he wears. He likes his clothes ironed. He does most of the cooking in the motel room, while Peggy does most of the shopping, either with food stamps at the grocery store or by visiting food banks.</p>
		<p>Johnny doesn&rsquo;t work, he says, because he injured his neck years ago working construction. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t nobody want to hire a 55-year-old man,&rdquo; he says.</p>
		<p>Peggy was born in Toledo, Ohio, and left for Florida in 2005 when she was 24 and fleeing an abusive relationship.</p>
		<p>Peggy&rsquo;s 20s were a mess of marijuana and cocaine. She lost Jaquan and Matthew for several months because of drug problems, and landed in an in-patient rehab center in Florida. That&rsquo;s where she met Johnny. She was pregnant with Shay-Shay.</p>

		<p>Peggy and Johnny came to Colorado when Peggy was pregnant with Mimi. They rented a one-bedroom apartment for $600 per month and eventually moved to a three-bedroom place in an apartment complex a few blocks from the King&rsquo;s Inn. But that didn&rsquo;t last.</p>

	</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
	<div class="large-8 large-centered medium-10 medium-centered small-12 columns">
		<p class="lead">Along a stretch of East Colfax Avenue at the edge of Aurora, the parking lots of seedy, $24-a-day motels have become playgrounds. The local 7-Eleven, with its aisles of chips, pop and a few stray bananas, is called the &ldquo;grocery store.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>This is base for a high concentration of Colorado&rsquo;s &ldquo;invisibly homeless&rdquo; children, kids crowded into motel rooms or piled up with other families. Amid their chaotic and transient lives, education suffers. They bounce from school to school, each time falling further behind.</p>
		<p>The number of homeless schoolchildren in this state has more than tripled in the past 10 years &mdash; from 7,000 to more than 23,300 students last school year. Some are living in cars or shelters or campgrounds, and many are doubled up with other families or in motels. They are homeless under a federal education law called the <a href="javascript:void(0);" data-reveal-id="theact">McKinney-Vento Act</a>, which requires school districts to provide them transportation, lunch and immediate enrollment.</p>
		<p>They aren&rsquo;t found holding cardboard signs on the street or camping under bridges. Yet they are growing up with their belongings in plastic sacks, waiting on community volunteers who bring food and shampoo to motel parking lots, wondering how long until their family&rsquo;s next move.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a much more hidden and invisible population, and it&rsquo;s challenging for schools to identify them,&rdquo; said Barbara Duffield, policy director at the National Association for the Education of Homeless Children and Youth in Washington, D.C. &ldquo;The general public may not even see them or consider them to be homeless because they are not on a street corner like a single homeless adult.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Nearly 200 homeless children attend six elementary schools closest to Aurora&rsquo;s motel row, a string of run-down dwellings where kids live among society&rsquo;s outcasts &mdash; recent parolees and registered sex offenders. Prostitution, drug deals and bloody fistfights happen in daylight.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;They have this sense that what the world says about them is true. Every day we fight that,&rdquo; said Kelley Birschbach, who helps run an after-school program at <a href="http://colfaxcommunitynetwork.org/" title="Colfax Community Network - An Avenue of Hope">Colfax Community Network</a> for homeless children living in the area. The program has enough funding for only 25 of those 200 children.</p>
		<p>It&rsquo;s not unusual for the nonprofit program&rsquo;s two small buses, returning kids after dinner and homework, to pull up to a fight or shouting match in a motel parking lot. One child went to school the day after a murder at his motel. &ldquo;I mean, how does a kid come back the next day and focus on their homework?&rdquo; Birschbach asked.</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">Battling the odds</h3>

		<p class="lead">Homeless students have twice as many learning disabilities as other schoolchildren. They also are three times as likely to act out in class with emotional disturbances, national data show.</p>
		<p>They switch schools at a rate more than twice that of other students, starting over again as the new kid unfamiliar to teachers and peers, according to state Department of Education data released to The Denver Post.</p>
		<p>School transfers, especially for high school students, typically result in negative impacts on learning, on top of social and emotional difficulties.</p>
		<p>In the past three years, the number of &ldquo;unaccompanied youth&rdquo; attending Colorado high schools jumped 50 percent, from 1,325 to 1,989 last year.</p>
		<p>They fend for themselves.</p>


		<p>Higher dropout and mobility rates are reasons federal law requires school districts to cover the transportation costs for homeless students who want to continue attending their &ldquo;school of origin,&rdquo; even when they have moved outside of school boundaries. For some children, school is the only stability they&rsquo;ve got.</p>
		<p>There is no room and maybe even no bed of their own in the places they call home.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;When you think about school, a student has a desk of their own with their own school supplies and their backpack, the teacher that they know, their friends &mdash; it becomes a stability factor,&rdquo; said Dana Scott, Colorado Department of Education coordinator for the McKinney-Vento program.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Motels are what they know. Education becomes vital to breaking that cycle,&rdquo; she said.</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">Statistically invisible</h3>

		<p class="lead">A growing number of homeless students come from families homeless for the first time.</p>
		<p>Experts say the startling rise in homeless children is the result of several years of economic recession and a housing market in the Denver area that is as tight as it has ever been. Wait lists for subsidized housing in the city are months, even years, long.</p>
		<p>School officials have gotten better at identifying children who qualify under the homeless law by interviewing them and their parents, which has contributed to the rise in numbers. However, they believe the consistent surge in the past few years is more the result of a tough economy than any other reason.</p>
		<p>Many of Colorado&rsquo;s homeless families are considered chronically homeless, without a stable home for so long that homelessness has become the key experience of their children&rsquo;s lives.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;These numbers are heartbreaking,&rdquo; the state&rsquo;s Scott said.</p>

		<p class="caption" style="margin-bottom:3em;"><span class="captionhed">watch.</span> A documentary follows Colorado schoolchildren who are homeless under federal education law, living in motels, shelters and other families' bedrooms and basements. They bounce from school to school as their families move across the city. The repercussions are profound.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
	<div class="large-8 large-centered medium-10 medium-centered small-12 columns">
		<p>It is frustrating to advocates for <span id="hilite-1">homeless children that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span> does not count kids living in other families&rsquo; living rooms or basements as being homeless, as the U.S. Department of Education does. In one Colorado school district, officials discovered three families sharing the same mobile home; some of the children were sleeping on the ground under the home, after they had boarded up the sides for warmth.</p>
		<p>When families are not counted as homeless, they often don&rsquo;t qualify for federal housing assistance. And they typically are not tallied on a city&rsquo;s annual, point-in-time homeless count.</p>
		<p>Nationally, the number of homeless children in schools has gone up 72 percent since 2006. Meanwhile, federal money to pay for homeless students&rsquo; transportation and extra services to catch them up to their peers has barely budged.</p>
		<p>The McKinney-Vento program, which began in 1987, has had an annual budget of about $65 million for the last decade. The Obama administration has not requested more, instead putting priority on ending chronic and veteran homelessness.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;The administration has really put adults over children,&rdquo; said the national association&rsquo;s Duffield. &ldquo;Those kids are going to be your chronically homeless if we don&rsquo;t break the cycle now.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>President Barack Obama&rsquo;s plan to end homelessness, which has a 12 percent budget increase next year, puts greater emphasis on expanding affordable housing for families than on homeless children&rsquo;s education. Funding for education is only one piece of the solution, said Laura Zeilinger, executive director of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness under Obama.</p>
		<p>In Congress, the Senate Education Committee has requested that the Government Accountability Office study the effectiveness of the homeless education program. The report has not been released, but experts familiar with the findings said investigators found examples of school districts encouraging homeless children to go elsewhere because of the perceived extra costs.</p>
		<p>Only one state, Illinois, has added its own money to the federal program.</p>
		<p>In Colorado, there is no state funding for the program, which relies solely on federal dollars. Per-student funding in this state has dropped from $64 per year in 2003 to $28 last year.</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">Student liaisons</h3>

		<p class="lead">Each school district in Colorado has a homeless-student liaison, but for most, it&rsquo;s a position tacked onto other duties. Two-thirds of liaisons in the state reported having just 45 minutes or less per day to work on homeless student issues. Only the largest districts and the ones with the highest percentage of homeless students have full-time liaisons for homeless students.</p>
		<p>A change in the latest federal budget allows school districts to dip into other federal funds for disadvantaged students. This gave school districts access to funds to pay for homeless students&rsquo; transportation, but they have to take it out of other programs.</p>
		<p>School districts have relied on community nonprofits and volunteers to fill in the gaps for homeless children, including sending needy kids home on Fridays with backpacks full of food.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re seeing students come to school on Monday hungry and falling asleep in class because of the weekend gap in the free meals we can offer in schools,&rdquo; said state coordinator Scott.</p>
		<p>At Aurora Public Schools, which has the largest population of homeless children in the state, McKinney-Vento liaisons try to connect homeless families with housing programs in the metro area. They also visit motels or shelters to check on their students, talking to parents about concerns regarding homework, hygiene and transportation to school when a family has no car.</p>
		<p>Aurora school liaisons have discovered students living in garages, unfinished basements and a van parked at Walmart. The district had 2,300 homeless students in a daily count made last fall. It made major changes three years ago to handle the rapidly rising number, including putting a homeless program case manager at each school.</p>
		<p>Fees are waived for high school students who are homeless, and liaisons help them find transcripts from other schools so they don&rsquo;t lose credit. Before <a href="javascript:void(0);" data-reveal-id="theact">McKinney-Vento</a>, homeless students were required to show proof of residence in a district before enrolling.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It was a barrier, and some of them sat at home,&rdquo; said Dale Cornelius, McKinney-Vento liaison for Aurora schools.</p>
		<p>Now, if a student&rsquo;s homelessness is in question, districts must provide immediate enrollment while they verify proof of address.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
	<div class="large-8 large-centered medium-10 medium-centered small-12 columns">
		<p>A Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group, the National Law Center on Homelessness &amp; Poverty, is the watchdog for the rights of homeless students. The center intervenes for students when school districts are accused of not providing free transportation or immediate enrollment, among other rights guaranteed in the federal act.</p>
		<p>Some school districts push back against the law because it&rsquo;s an underfunded mandate, said center attorney Lisa Coleman Curtis. Districts don&rsquo;t want to foot the bill on transportation costs for a homeless student who has moved outside school boundaries. Also, schools may not want to enroll a homeless student because they fear it will bring down scores on high-stakes tests, she said.</p>
		<p>Despite inadequate funding, the center pushes districts to spend more on homeless kids because education is one of the keys to breaking the cycle of intergenerational homelessness, Curtis said.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Homelessness is a modern status in our country &mdash; there used to not be homeless people,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;More recently, we are seeing that homelessness is becoming generational. That&rsquo;s scary, and that&rsquo;s tragic. And that shouldn&rsquo;t happen in our country.&rdquo;</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">Long-term effects</h3>

		<p class="lead">Homelessness affects not only education but causes psychological harm that, among other things, places homeless children at higher risk of becoming homeless adults.</p>
		<p>Children normally have adults to help regulate their stress, to calm them and provide consistency. But homeless children grow up in a constant state of stress, repeatedly traumatized, said Jennifer Perlman, a psychologist at the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;There is no one more important than their parent to them,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They know their parent is not OK. They can feel it on a cellular level by looking in their face. Will there be food? Won&rsquo;t there be food? Will she yell at me today? Will she hit me today?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Parents trying to raise kids without a home often are consumed by more-immediate needs than whether a child did his homework or had time to chat about the school day.</p>

<div class="row">
	<div class="large-8 large-centered medium-10 medium-centered small-12 columns">
		<p>The long-term effects of growing up this way are severe.</p>
		<p>When children don&rsquo;t learn to regulate their own emotions, when they feel traumatized and anxious for much of their childhood, it can lead to mental illness.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;The child is not learning how to regulate their own emotions, which is the hallmark of every mental illness,&rdquo; Perlman said.</p>
		<p>Housing for homeless families has grown harder to come by in the Denver area the past several years, said John Parvensky, president of the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless. Most of the subsidized housing projects in the city offer one- or two-bedroom apartments, not large enough for big families.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Most of the housing that&rsquo;s being built now is luxury housing. And as more young professionals move into town and more families are competing for the rental housing stock, we&rsquo;re seeing more and more families unable to afford the rents that are out there,&rdquo; he said.</p>
		<p>Birschbach, who runs the after-school program in Aurora, isn&rsquo;t trying to fix the housing crisis or even break the cycle of poverty. His role is mentor, big brother and on some days even dad to the children he picks up from school each afternoon. He tries to give them dignity, and he wishes others would see them as he does.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;This is happening in our backyard,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When we don&rsquo;t know someone, we tend to dehumanize them or create barriers where we stay separate from them. What they are having to go against is way different than what we have to go against.&rdquo;</p>

		<p class="lead">A slit of sunrise is barely visible in the dark Denver sky when the kids tumble one by one onto the porch bundled in donated bulky coats and snow hats.</p>
		<p>It&rsquo;s their mom&rsquo;s payday, and there is time before school to walk up Lincoln Avenue to McDonald&rsquo;s for coffee and breakfast burritos from the dollar menu.</p>
		<p>It&rsquo;s barely 6:30 a.m., but they must head outside this early to make it to school on time. The Bolden children and their mom will catch the bus to get downtown, transfer to the No. 15 that runs along Colfax Avenue to the east end of Aurora and step off five blocks from their elementary school. The trek takes more than an hour.</p>
		<p>The kids &mdash; Aleka, Alayis, Alex and Dejanique &mdash; make themselves comfortable on the No. 15.</p>
		<p>This is their bus.</p>
		<p>They head to the back and spread out, playing &ldquo;smile if you love me&rdquo; to pass the time. &ldquo;Deja,&rdquo; a 4-year-old with still-chubby cheeks and long eyelashes, grabs a spot along the back row without even glancing at two stone-faced men wearing ear buds as she squeezes between them. The kids are hyped up on juice and coffee with several packets of sugar.</p>
		<p>Alex, 8, presses his forehead against the window to people watch along the avenue, sipping his coffee. A second-grader, he is missing his front tooth and his hair is sticking up everywhere. Older sisters Aleka and Alayis have rips in the knees of their pants; they wear yesterday&rsquo;s clothes.</p>

		<p>The bus passes two police cars, lights swirling, in a motel parking lot. &ldquo;Another day on Colfax,&rdquo; says the children&rsquo;s mom, Heather Bolden, with a smile and an eye roll. &ldquo;Every day is an adventure.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The oldest three kids started at Paris Elementary a year earlier while they were living in a squalid motel along East Colfax in Aurora. Even after the family of six found a back bedroom in a crowded Denver house to rent for $50 a week, Heather wanted to keep them in the same school.</p>
		<p>She is willing to make the two-hour round trip each school day to get them there. The school district gives them free bus tickets because the kids are homeless and it&rsquo;s federal law that homeless students are provided transportation to their &ldquo;school of origin.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the one thing I could keep the same for them, with all the other changes they had to go through,&rdquo; Heather says.</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">Falling behind</h3>

		<p class="lead">&ldquo;The fact is that most things in life are out of your control,&rdquo; Aleka&rsquo;s fifth-grade teacher is saying as the class reads a Mary Pope Osborne short story.</p>
		<p>This isn&rsquo;t news to Aleka, who seems older than her 11 years, the protector of her three younger siblings. She watches over them so intensely sometimes that she forgets to have fun. But when she smiles, it is huge, showing off perfectly straight teeth.</p>
		<p>Their &ldquo;home,&rdquo; at least for a few months, is the cramped back room in a house where they are four of nine children living there. As the oldest, Aleka gets stuck watching all of them for the woman who rents the house. Mostly, the bedroom is a place to sleep.</p>
		<p>The family usually spends days out, either riding the bus or getting coffee at McDonald&rsquo;s or sitting in the park. The house is so dirty that food dropped on the floor isn&rsquo;t picked up for days. Heather and fiance Ronnie Lewis use a curtain for privacy.</p>
		<p>There is too much chaos in the house for studying.</p>

		<p>In class at Paris Elementary, Aleka is sitting on the floor with her friends reading the short story when she and two others are pulled out to read with a specialist who is trying to catch her up to grade level. They &ldquo;echo read&rdquo; &mdash; the teacher says the sentence and the kids repeat it.</p>
		<p>In another classroom, third-grader Alayis is journaling about her favorite book series, &ldquo;Diary of a Wimpy Kid.&rdquo; She is the only one of the three Bolden kids at Paris Elementary told she is slipping far enough behind that she should attend summer school. This embarrasses her to the point she will not say it aloud but will only write it on paper.</p>
		<p>Teachers at Alayis&rsquo; after-school program say she doesn&rsquo;t want to learn by reading or listening; she must experience it, touch it, explore it, sit in the middle of it. This fits her &mdash; she is athletic and physical, can flip and do pull-ups on the monkey bars with astonishing strength. She has moxie, they say. But Alayis thinks she isn&rsquo;t smart.</p>
		<p>Her family calls her &ldquo;Fat-fat,&rdquo; a nickname from her toddler days.</p>
		<p>Now she is all muscle.</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">After-school stability</h3>

		<p class="lead">The Bolden children don&rsquo;t get much homework help at home. Heather admits this, saying things have been too unstable. Many nights, she is closing up at the Little Caesars where she has worked for a year.</p>
		<p>Alayis is a year behind grade level in reading. Alex is more than a year behind in reading, math and science.</p>
		<p>The three oldest attend an after-school program through Colfax Community Network, a nonprofit that picks up homeless kids in two small buses after school, feeds them a meal, helps them study and then drops them off with their families, mostly at motels along Colfax.</p>
		<p>One afternoon last winter, the program&rsquo;s red bus pulled along the sidewalk at Montview Elementary and several kids climbed up the steps, some giving driver Kelley Birschbach high-fives or fist bumps.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on with you? Where&rsquo;s your joy?&rdquo; Birschbach asks a plodding glum-faced boy.</p>
		<p>Another kid asks Birschbach eagerly, &ldquo;Can we? Can we do it today?&rdquo; Birschbach shuts the front doors of the bus and lets the kid pound snowballs at the glass while Birschbach, making faces through the windows, pretends he&rsquo;s startled by each smack.</p>
		<p>The Bolden children hop on at Paris Elementary, trudging aboard in too-big snow coats and pants with ripped knees. After eight hours at school, they will spend the next two hours at the after-school program. They are dragging today.</p>

		<p>Tonight&rsquo;s dinner at the program is pizza instead of the usual pasta and veggies or casserole, which makes Alex groan. Since his mom started working at Little Caesars the Bolden kids have eaten more pizza than he ever wanted, sometimes four or five nights in a row.</p>
		<p>Birschbach calls Alex the littlest gangster, a boy with a don&rsquo;t-mess-with-me shell who dishes attitude. But some days, the shell cracks and he&rsquo;s a little boy asking for a hug.</p>
		<p>Sometimes, the buses that drop the rest of the after-school program kids off at motels along East Colfax take the Boldens to Little Caesars. They wait until their mom gets off or Ronnie can take them home.</p>
		<p>Deja often hangs out in the waiting area of the pizza restaurant, if her parents&rsquo; shifts overlap. The manager gives her bread sticks. Deja is alternately demanding and adorable, in the way that babies of their families have mastered. She doesn&rsquo;t go to preschool because the bus ride from Denver to Aurora takes almost as long as a preschool day.</p>
		<p>Paris Elementary and the Colfax Community Network have been the mainstays in the kids&rsquo; lives the last two years as they moved from motel to motel and were doubled up with other families. The Boldens moved every three or four months, and the after-school program helped them get food and find a place to stay when they didn&rsquo;t have one.</p>
		<p>Living at the filthy house along Lincoln Avenue lasts only about four months, when the Boldens find a room to rent from another friend. It is cleaner and less crowded, but still an hour away from school.</p>
		<p>The children&rsquo;s time at Paris Elementary has been the longest stretch they have stayed in the same school. Aleka, a fifth-grader, has attended five schools in Aurora and Denver, one of them for just two months.</p>

		<p>She is trying to make up for lost time, for the years she sold drugs to get by and wasn&rsquo;t sober. Things changed for the better after she, and then Ronnie, got jobs at Little Caesars &mdash; he starts making pizza dough at 4 a.m. and Heather often closes the place.</p>
		<p>Heather grew up in Topeka, Kan., where she was raised by her dad, a roofer. Her mom was &ldquo;in and out.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>She had a falling out with her dad over a boyfriend who later became her husband. The couple moved to Denver in 2004, spending the winter in a 1980 Chevy Caprice. She was pregnant with Aleka and had her oldest son, Xavier, now in foster care, with her.</p>
		<p>Eventually, the couple found work and an apartment in Denver, but the relationship was rocky and turned violent. One night he tried to kill her, cutting her in the neck. The scar is there to prove it.</p>
		<p>Heather fled. He went to jail. She hoped to live in the apartment with her then-four children, but the manager evicted her because of the domestic violence, Heather said.</p>
		<p>She spent the next few years bouncing from motels to shelters, including five stints at Brandon Center, a Volunteers of America shelter for homeless women and children. She sold drugs to get by.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Sometimes you got to hit rock bottom with your life until you can pick yourself back up. I&rsquo;ve just been trying to pick myself up ever since.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Heather lost her oldest son to foster care after he got in trouble at school and a criminal investigation began. She has been sober for three years, and is close to getting Xavier, now 14, returned to her.</p>
		<p>Heather accomplished everything child protection workers asked of her, except for finding a stable home.</p>
		<p>She signed up for so many wait lists for subsidized housing in cities throughout metro Denver that it&rsquo;s hard to keep track. She put her name in the lottery for a housing voucher 10 years running and never has been selected, she said.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;If you have an eviction, it&rsquo;s almost impossible. It seems nobody believes in second chances anymore.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>It was a friend from Heather&rsquo;s past that changed the Bolden family&rsquo;s luck.</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">No place like home</h3>

		<p class="lead">The stairs of the cement front porch have crumbled away. Inside, fresh plywood planks replaced the rotted floor. Sheets are nailed over the windows for curtains, and the smell of &ldquo;stray cats,&rdquo; as 10-year-old Alayis describes it, still lingers.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not much, but it&rsquo;s a home,&rdquo; says Heather, smoking a cigarette in the kitchen of the two-bedroom, white-brick house northeast of downtown Denver that they recently rented. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a place to make a home for the kids.&rdquo;
		<p>It is the first home they&rsquo;ve had to call their own in nearly two years.</p>

		<p>Two weeks after moving in, the kids are smiling more. They run in circles, through the arched entrances of the dining room, kitchen and living room, dizzy. Here, they can spread out, leave their stuff in the living room. They don&rsquo;t have to hole up in a borrowed back room, the only corner that was theirs. Ronnie is relaxed. There is less yelling.</p>
		<p>Heather had spent months trying to find someone who would rent to a woman with an arrest record and a history of eviction. She scoured newspaper ads and Craigslist, put her name on housing lists. Everyone wanted a background check and a huge deposit.</p>
		<p>She finally caught a break when a man she worked with years ago at a Taco Bell walked into Little Caesars while Heather was working. He had a house to rent and would let her move in if she helped fix it up, for only the first month&rsquo;s rent of $750 and no background check required.</p>
		<p>The only problem: The house was in north Denver, an hour&rsquo;s bus ride to their jobs in Aurora and even farther from the children&rsquo;s school. But it was a home.</p>
		<p>The children start a new school this month.</p>
		<p>Again.</p>
		<p>For Aleka, who is starting sixth grade, it will be her sixth school. A fat tear slips out of her eye and slides off her nose when she talks about the first day.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Humiliation,&rdquo; is what she foresees for that day. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t hang out with my best friends anymore,&rdquo; says the 11-year-old, biting her bottom lip.</p>
		<p>But she brightens, showing a flash of her million-dollar dimples, when she talks about what they could do with the new bedroom she shares with her two little sisters. She wants pink or purple walls, with decals of Hello Kitty, smiley faces and hearts.</p>

		<p>Younger sister Alayis is more optimistic about another first day of school as the new kid. She will wear her &ldquo;gray muscle shirt&rdquo; that says &ldquo;Sunshine Forever&rdquo; and she won&rsquo;t have to wake at sunrise to catch two buses across town. She can sleep longer and walk a few blocks up the street.</p>
		<p>Alayis was supposed to go to school this summer; her teachers said she needed a boost before she started fourth grade. But the schlep across town when her sister and brother didn&rsquo;t have to go, plus the move to a house, became too much for her mom. Alayis attended only for a week.</p>
		<p>Her cheeks flush when she talks about moving into the new house: &ldquo;It was like a whole new world because we have much more space. We can run around and we get to play and watch TV and no one is in my way.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Alex likes the house because &ldquo;when we go to bed there are no spiders and cockroaches.&rdquo; And he gets his own place to sleep. &ldquo;This is my bedroom,&rdquo; he says, pointing to the couch in the living room. In the last place, &ldquo;we had to be squished up in a bed.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>He thinks he has lived in nine places. The worst was with the &ldquo;lady who let her kids be mean to us and we had to stay in the room and be bored.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Heather vows she and Ronnie &mdash; who both make close to minimum wage &mdash; will make rent, even if they have to skip the water or electricity bill. Heather just got a second job, working the overnight shift at a Taco Bell.</p>
		<p>This, she says, is their best move yet.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;They can actually be kids,&rdquo; Heather says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really good to see them be themselves again. That&rsquo;s the best part of it, seeing their personalities come out again. I&rsquo;m just glad to see them happy again. It didn&rsquo;t take long.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>In the kitchen, Alayis is making a cheese quesadilla on the stove. She forgets to turn off the burner and the pan begins to smoke, filling up the house. Heather is too happy seeing her daughter learn to cook &mdash; in their own kitchen &mdash; to worry about scolding her.</p>

	<h3>The McKinney-Vento Act</h3>

	<p>The McKinney-Vento Homeless Education Assistance Act is a federal law that guarantees immediate enrollment and transportation to the &ldquo;school of origin&rdquo; for homeless children.</p>
	<p>The act defines homeless children as those who lack &ldquo;a fixed, regular and adequate nighttime residence,&rdquo; including those:
	<ul>
	<li>doubled up due to loss of housing or economic hardship;</li>
