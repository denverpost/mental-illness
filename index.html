		</div>
	</div>
</div>

<section class="row" id="health">
	<div class="large-9 large-centered medium-11 medium-centered small-12 columns">
		<p class="lead">Dee Fleming tried to protect her son from the voices in his head, the ones that told him he should die.</p>
		<p>She chased after him the night he ran toward the neighborhood church with a baseball bat in his hand. She worried to the point of exhaustion when he didn&rsquo;t come home at night, then returned beat-up and missing his watch. She thought she was holding it together, if barely.</p>
		<p>One day last April, when he was oddly quiet and confused, almost catatonic, Fleming took him to Swedish Medical Center&rsquo;s emergency room and told doctors he was suicidal.</p>
		<p>They sent him home.</p>
		<p>Two days later, Fleming&rsquo;s son downed dozens of prescription medications and household cleaning supplies, doused himself with gasoline and set himself on fire in her front yard. He lived only because a neighbor called 911 to report something smoldering on the lawn. A police officer who knew him kept him conscious until an ambulance arrived.</p>
		<p>What came next for the Fleming family was almost as shocking, a battle for treatment that epitomizes the massive breakdown in care for mental illness in Colorado and the nation.</p>
		<p>Doctors treated his burns&mdash;but not his mind.</p>
		<p>Despite the family&rsquo;s pleas and a months-long battle, their 37-year-old son was released from Porter Adventist Hospital to a transitional shelter.</p>
		<p>The mental health care system is in crisis. More than 50 years after states began shuttering mental institutions, the system hasn&rsquo;t recovered&mdash;leaving emergency rooms, jails and shelters as last-ditch stops to handle the most severe cases.</p>
		<p>Each year in Colorado, about 260,000 adults and children need treatment for the most severe mental illnesses&mdash;schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression and serious emotional disturbances. Yet tens of thousands go without care; nationally, only about a third of people who need treatment get it.</p>
		<p>Colorado is paying millions of dollars to treat people with severe mental illness after their disease has escalated to the point of catastrophe instead of investing more in care when it strikes. Of the $887 million spent in Colorado on mental health in 2010 from all sources, half went to treatment of needy patients in clinics and state psychiatric hospitals. The rest was spent in prisons, jails, hospital emergency rooms and psychiatric units, and the child welfare system.</p>
		<p>The problem isn&rsquo;t as simple as limited government resources. Hospitals get more money from insurance companies by fixing physical conditions rather than mental ones, and they refer to their psychiatric units&mdash;if they have them&mdash;as charitable operations.</p>
		<p>The fallout from this shortage in care is severe: suicides, mass shootings, a huge population of prisoners, the homeless on the streets.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only condition for which we wait until stage 4 to try to treat,&rdquo; said Moe Keller, a former state senator and now vice president of public policy for Mental Health America of Colorado. &ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t do this with cancer. If someone went to their doctor with a tumor, they wouldn&rsquo;t say wait until stage 4. But they do it with mental health.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Families struggle to find help before it&rsquo;s too late, navigating a confusing health system with too few options and battling a Colorado law they say is so weak that they can&rsquo;t make treatment decisions when their loved ones are too sick to realize they need help.</p>
		<p>Attempts to strengthen that law have failed, even after violent events in Colorado have raised alarms over failures of the country&rsquo;s mental health system. And even as Colorado&rsquo;s suicide rate has risen to the sixth highest in the nation.</p>
		<p>The state ranks near the bottom in per-capita psychiatric treatment beds reported by private hospitals and in the bottom half in per-capita state and federal spending on mental health.</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">Fighting for help</h3>

		<p class="lead">Dee Fleming&rsquo;s son&mdash;burned so severely on his torso, arms and legs that he had to wear a skin suit&mdash;spent 10 months in University Hospital&rsquo;s burn unit. His mother recalls just four psychiatric visits during that time, and when his burns no longer required hospitalization, doctors said he was free to go. He did not need in-patient psychiatric treatment for his schizoaffective disorder, they said.</p>
		<p>Only when the Flemings hired a lawyer and threatened to sue the hospital did University administrators find their son a bed at a psychiatric center called Bridge House. A psychiatrist there recommended a 90-day hold, diagnosing serious mental health issues that put him in danger.</p>
		<p>But the burns were too severe for Bridge House to treat, and within days the center sent him to Porter Adventist Hospital. Porter kept him for just four days, determining he no longer needed in-patient care. The hospital released him to a temporary, assisted-living shelter for people with mental illness.</p>
		<p>It was freezing cold in the middle of winter, and his burns were still healing. &ldquo;They gave him a blanket and said goodbye,&rdquo; Fleming said. &ldquo;This is not humanity.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Officials at Porter and University would not talk about the case because of privacy laws, only saying they cannot legally hold a patient who is not an imminent danger to himself or others. In other words, under Colorado law, if a person is not planning to kill himself or murder someone right now, that person does not fit the legal requirement for treatment.</p>
		<p>The Flemings considered sending their son to a private psychiatric treatment center, without doctor&rsquo;s orders and without insurance authorization. But it was $20,000 per month. Instead, they rescued him from the shelter and put him up in a hotel, then an apartment.</p>
		<p>He has Medicaid and now receives treatment at the Mental Health Center of Denver.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late for our family. What is done is done,&rdquo; Fleming said. &ldquo;But this needs to change for other families.&rdquo;</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">Hours or days or never</h3>

		<p class="lead">Hospital emergency rooms are built to handle heart attacks and gunshot wounds. Not mental breakdowns.</p>
		<p>Yet they are filled with patients having panic attacks or suicidal thoughts. People seeking mental health treatment at the ER usually are sent away with phone numbers of local therapists. The wait to see a psychiatrist in this city is about five months long. Colorado has only 15 psychiatrists per 100,000 people, compared with 92 primary-care physicians.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t stabilize a mental health crisis with a Band-Aid around the head,&rdquo; said Scott Glaser, executive director of the Colorado branch of the National Alliance on Mental Illness.</p>
		<p>At University Hospital, which closed its psychiatric department six years ago, about 750 people per month&mdash;or 10 percent of visitors to the emergency department&mdash;come for mental health reasons.</p>
		<p>Colorado law mandates that hospitals can&rsquo;t turn away someone who is suicidal, homicidal or so &ldquo;gravely disabled&rdquo; that they can&rsquo;t manage to take care of themselves by finding food or shelter. But most hospitals have no place&mdash;other than an ER bed&mdash;to treat a mental health patient. Hospitals keep them until they can find a psychiatric bed at another hospital or private treatment center.</p>
		<p>This can take hours. Or days. Or never. Colorado hospitals report fewer psychiatric hospital beds per capita than most states, according to American Hospital Association data.</p>
		<p>Hospitals here, including University and St. Anthony&rsquo;s, closed their psychiatric units because the units were losing money. One doctor called it an oxymoron to say &ldquo;moneymaking psychiatric department.&rdquo; The issue is that insurance companies reimburse hospitals at a higher rate for physical health care than mental health care.</p>
		<p>The number of psychiatric beds at Colorado&rsquo;s two state mental hospitals for patients whose care has been taken over by the state and those sent from state courts, in Pueblo and Denver, has slid from 611 a decade ago to 543 now.</p>
		<p>Finding an open bed can feel like a scavenger hunt.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an order of magnitude more difficult in Colorado,&rdquo; said Dr. Rich Zane, chairman of emergency medicine at University of Colorado School of Medicine and who moved to Colorado two years ago from a hospital in Boston. &ldquo;An order of magnitude would be a conservative description.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Out of the 9,000 patients per year who come into University&rsquo;s ER with mental health issues, just fewer than 1,000 are placed on 72-hour holds by doctors. Some spend the entire hold in an ER exam room because no psychiatric bed was found.</p>
		<p>The majority of the 28,000 psychiatric holds in Colorado in 2012 were related to suicidal thoughts or attempts. More than 2,500 were people placed on more than one hold that year.</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">Mental health &ldquo;parity&rdquo;</h3>

		<p class="lead">The federal Affordable Care Act created &ldquo;parity&rdquo; for mental health care, requiring insurance companies to provide their customers the same coverage for mental health treatment as they do for other care. But the law does not affect negotiations between hospitals and insurance companies, said Ben Price, executive director of the Colorado Association of Health Plans.</p>
		<p>Hospital officials say that despite the law, they recoup less from private insurance companies for mental care than physical care. Denver Health, for example, is reimbursed for 32 percent of mental health billing compared with 41 percent for other medical care, according to the hospital&rsquo;s financial office. Other hospitals refused to disclose that data. Experts say it&rsquo;s too early to measure how the new health care law is increasing treatment for mental health patients.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty remarkable that insurance companies treat psychiatric care different than they treat all other care,&rdquo; Zane said. &ldquo;For some reason, brain failure is different than heart failure. That is one of the intrinsic prejudices against psychiatric insurance, and it&rsquo;s pervasive.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Insurance company executives said while it&rsquo;s true that psychiatric care generally is reimbursed at a lower rate than surgical care, rates negotiated between hospitals and insurance companies vary widely across medical specialities.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I do understand that we do have a psychiatric problem in this state,&rdquo; said Neil Waldron, chief marketing officer for Rocky Mountain Health Plans. &ldquo;But how we negotiate with the hospitals is a mutually agreed upon thing.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Denver Health Medical Center is one of the few hospitals that has psychiatric emergency services, a secure, nine-bed section separate from the main emergency department. The unit sees 3,800 patients each year, of which about 900 are admitted. <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="startVideo" id="hilite1" onclick="playerScroller('video3', 'Q5b3JkcTpaLJDDENZwHn_zMBA1nyDsma', this);">Most come for evaluation</a> after police or ER doctors have placed them on mental health holds.</p>

		<p>Some patients are able to leave within hours, after family meetings and help dealing with their immediate stress. Others are sent to the 36-bed, long-term psychiatric unit, where the average stay is about seven days.</p>
		<p>Kim Nordstrom, the medical director of psychiatric emergency services, also has a law degree. Her professional degrees are at odds when she encounters a homeless person with mental illness who chooses to eat from the trash and sleep in the cold, yet has no signs of dehydration or malnutrition.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I would not want to live that way and we don&rsquo;t like to see other people live that way, but they have a right to,&rdquo; Nordstrom said. She can, however, hold a patient if the person&rsquo;s psychosis is interfering with the ability to make a plan to find food and shelter.</p>
		<p>The Medical Center of Aurora&mdash;which opened a 40-bed psychiatric unit in 2012, the first one to open in the metro area in 10 years&mdash;gets patients from as far as Pueblo and Wyoming. The unit is almost always filled to capacity, which it caps at 32 because there are not enough psychiatrists to staff a unit of 40 people.</p>
		<p>Nationally, psychiatrists are scarce, their numbers dwindling further as the profession becomes less lucrative than other specialities. In some rural parts of Colorado, there are none.</p>
		<p>For the past 10 years, Denver psychiatrist Randy Buzan&rsquo;s voice mail has said he is not accepting new patients. He already has 400. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m buried. I just don&rsquo;t have time for all these people,&rdquo; he said.</p>
		<p>Like many psychiatrists, Buzan does not take insurance and instead charges patients on a sliding scale because that&rsquo;s easier and more profitable than dealing with insurance companies. Buzan said he and some other psychiatrists avoid taking suicidal or homicidal patients because of the risks of a lawsuit if patients end up committing murder or killing themselves.</p>
		<p>The Medical Center of Aurora built its psychiatric unit as a &ldquo;community service&rdquo; because its emergency rooms at all HealthONE hospitals in Colorado were warehousing patients in mental health crisis. Patients are not getting treatment before they reach crisis, and often not after leaving hospitals either, said Teresa Mayer, medical director of the psychiatric unit.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have anywhere to send them. Imagine if you had appendicitis and there was nowhere to go for follow-up,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s terrible. What could have been prevented is not preventable when there is no one to care for them.&rdquo;</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">Urgent need</h3>

		<p class="lead">Colorado ranks in the bottom half of states in mental health spending per capita.</p>
		<p>The state budget to care for needy patients without insurance at 17 community mental health clinics was $40.7 million this year. That&rsquo;s the same as it was in 2008, when major budget cuts took a chunk out of mental health care that has taken six years to restore. About 145,000 people per year receive therapy at the centers, spread across the state.</p>
		<p>A study by Colorado health foundations tallied 2010 spending on all mental health treatment statewide to be at $887 million. Of that, slightly more than half was spent by the state office of behavioral health. The state prison system and county jails spent $93 million in taxpayer money; the child welfare system spent nearly $5 million; and hospitals spent $182 million, according to the</p>
		<p>Advancing Colorado&rsquo;s Mental Health Care report.</p>
		<p>Colorado has plans to create walk-in and mobile mental health crisis services in four regions of the state, alternatives to emergency rooms for those in immediate need and part of Gov. John Hickenlooper&rsquo;s effort to increase services after the 2012 Aurora theater shooting that left 12 dead and 70 injured. Suspect James Holmes has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, making his mental status a focal point for trial.</p>
		<p>Adding to the urgency was the Arapahoe High School shooting a year ago in which an 18-year-old boy with a &ldquo;significant history&rdquo; of mental problems and a pump-action shotgun murdered one of his classmates and killed himself.</p>
		<p>The state legislature approved $20 million for the crisis centers as well as a statewide mental health hotline last year, but the project was hung up in court for several months over the fairness of the bid.</p>
		<p>The crisis centers are welcome, but they aren&rsquo;t enough, say mental health advocates, who wish the state would focus more on expanding mental health care at primary care practices.</p>
		<p>One in four people will have a mental illness in their lifetime, most commonly depression or anxiety. One in 17 will suffer from the most serious diseases of the mind &mdash; schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, extreme paranoia.</p>
		<p>Many in need of mental health treatment never get any.</p>
		<p>Of the 683,000 needy and disabled Coloradans who had Medicaid government insurance last year, 93,700 received behavioral health care in 2013.</p>
		<p>That&rsquo;s about one in seven&mdash;not the expected one in four who experienced mental health problems that year.</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">Caught in the middle</h3>

		<p class="lead">The mental health system serves the extreme, even while most people with mental illness are in the middle&mdash;not needy enough to qualify for Medicaid and not willing to park their cars outside mental health clinics that serve the deep-end-of-the-pool category. It&rsquo;s the new mom with post-partum depression who gets left out.</p>
		<p>The stigma attached to mental health clinics keeps people still holding it together from going there.</p>
		<p>Community mental health clinics were not intended to care for only the neediest patients but have &ldquo;become a dumping ground for the poor and underserved,&rdquo; said Dr. Ben Miller, director of the Farley Health Policy Center at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.</p>
		<p>The solution, say experts, is to bring mental health care into the offices of primary care doctors. Physical checkups should include mental health screenings and, if needed, a visit by a psychiatrist just down the hall, said Miller, one of a group of experts on a Colorado Health Foundation panel studying the integration of mental and physical health care.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;What I want to do is normalize mental health care. Separate systems of care perpetuate that stigma,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I dispel myths quite a bit &mdash; &lsquo;Those are the crazy people. Those are the people who shoot up our malls and kill our kids.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
		<p>A 2014 study found that just 12 percent of patients who were sent to another office for mental health therapy completed treatment, compared with 77 percent of patients who were offered that care in the same exam room.</p>
		<p>Among the best models in the country is Tennessee-based Cherokee Health Systems, a 56-clinic, federally qualified community health center that treats the underserved.</p>
		<p>Every patient is screened for depression and anxiety just as they are checked for high blood pressure, height and weight. A behavioral therapist visits each patient.</p>
		<p>There is no referral. No recommendation the patient drive to a mental health clinic down the road.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;As soon as they think they are getting something different, we have lost that perspective that this is part of their primary care,&rdquo; said Parinda Khatri, chief clinical officer at Cherokee.</p>
		<p>Patients who saw mental health consultants in conjunction with their medical care used medical services 28 percent less often during the next two years. Cherokee patients also had the lowest rates of psychiatric hospital admissions of all community health centers in Tennessee, according to data from one of the state&rsquo;s largest insurance companies.</p>
		<p>Physical and mental health care typically happen in different places in part because insurance reimburses doctors per treatment per patient, instead of a combined payment for treating a person&rsquo;s whole health.</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">Edge of losing everything</h3>

		<p class="lead">Sue Pelletier&rsquo;s voice cracks, tears streaming, when she tries to explain how she and her husband arrived at the edge of losing everything.</p>
		<p>A few years ago, she had it all &mdash; the kind of marriage people hope for, two healthy kids, and a three-bedroom home with a pool table and a wine cellar.</p>
		<p>Her husband, Tom, once &ldquo;salesman of the year,&rdquo; made money enough to keep her &ldquo;spoiled&rdquo; selling unique auto parts. &ldquo;We were very sure of ourselves,&rdquo; she said.</p>
		<p>Until what she calls his &ldquo;nervous breakdown.&rdquo;</p>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="large-12 large-centered medium-12 medium-centered small-12 columns">
				<div class="centerphoto">
					<img src="./img/breakdown-3494.jpg">
					<p class="caption">Sue Pelletier kneels next to her husband Tom during a panic attack at their home in Brighton. Sue encourages Tom to pray, &quot;Take a couple of deep breaths. Let it out. Say Jesus.&quot; Tom repeats, &quot;Jesus.&rdquo; She said, &quot;Just tell Satan, &lsquo;Go to hell.&rsquo;&quot; Tom repeated, &quot;Satan, go to hell.&rdquo;</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>Now the Pelletiers have a for-sale sign on their Brighton lawn and $12,000 in credit card debt. They have tapped out their savings and their retirement. Tom, 61, is too depressed and anxious to work; he mostly sleeps and wakes only to take his anti-depressants and anti-anxiety pills. Everything &mdash; visits from his grandsons, picking out clothes, cooking&mdash;stresses him out.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to do life anymore,&rdquo; he recently told his wife.</p>
		<p>Tom&rsquo;s eyes are flat. He never smiles. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel like I have anything to offer anybody because I&rsquo;m all dried up,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m like an empty bucket. There is nothing that brings me joy anymore. I have to psych myself up to mow the lawn. I guess because everything seems so pointless.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>For months, Tom held back his anxiety, tried to push it down, before he &ldquo;crashed.&rdquo; Then he couldn&rsquo;t hide it anymore. He woke his wife before dawn one morning in 1997, touched her arm and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in trouble.&rdquo; Anxiety had overtaken him to the point he could not get dressed. He kept repeating himself: &ldquo;What am I going to do?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>He had never before talked to a mental health therapist. And on the advice of a friend who was a doctor, Sue did not take him to a mental hospital because of the stigma.</p>
		<p>Tom could not work in sales again. Instead, he rotated through various jobs, usually in another town because it was too embarrassing for friends in Brighton to see him struggle.</p>
		<p>He would manage for a year or more, until another episode. Tom slipped into his current episode two years ago, when Sue hospitalized him for the first time because she feared he was going to kill himself. The private psychiatric center kept him nine days. They cashed out their retirement savings.</p>
		<p>Sue wishes now she had taken her husband to a psychiatrist or a mental health hospital during his first episode. She wishes they hadn&rsquo;t tried to hide his illness for so long. She prays with him every day.</p>
		<p>Tom feels trapped from life by his mind.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;My mind is constantly racing over negative stuff: Having to get a job. We have old cars. I&rsquo;m 60 years old. What am I going to do?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>They are praying the house will sell before their next mortgage payment is due. &ldquo;We just don&rsquo;t know where it&rsquo;s going to end, or how it&rsquo;s going to end,&rdquo; Tom said.</p>
		<p>Susan, now a flight attendant, worries each time she leaves for a four-day run about what she may find when she returns. She cringes thinking about how relatives have told Tom to &ldquo;just buck up.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Well, you know what? You don&rsquo;t have a clue,&rdquo; she tells them. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s tried to buck up for years, but it keeps coming back.&rdquo;</p>

		<p class="lead">A sinister storm is rumbling and sparking behind Timothy Heckler&rsquo;s silhouette as he tears off his T-shirt on a warm July night and chugs Fat Bastard pinot noir from the bottle.</p>
		<p>Ferocious wind pelts his bare chest with dirt and pebbles. Rain slaps him. The trees next to his Littleton campsite along the High Line Canal Trail are bent by the gusts. Timothy clenches his fist, turns his back to the storm and shouts, &ldquo;The weather speaks to me!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Besides the sale-price wine, his backpack contains a paperback on leadership and &mdash; in case it rains all night while he sleeps outside &mdash; a tarp. He doesn&rsquo;t have to sleep here; he could stay with his grandmother or friends. But Timothy, 29, and his grandmother fought earlier: &ldquo;This whole situation doesn&rsquo;t require her understanding,&rdquo; he says. He is out here to &ldquo;cleanse,&rdquo; to &ldquo;gain clarity&rdquo; and to &ldquo;feel free against the noose I&rsquo;ve hung myself with.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;On homeless days such as these,&rdquo; he wisecracks,because he can&rsquo;t be serious for longer than two minutes, &ldquo;I prefer to kick back, relax, crack open a book and open a bottle of wine.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>This night, among croaking frogs and summer rain, is a turning point, when a lifetime of mental illness and drug abuse seem to suck him under. It&rsquo;s what happens when the mental health system fails, and when someone won&rsquo;t help himself.</p>
		<p>Here, surrounded by the excitement of a wild storm, it hasn&rsquo;t hit him yet how deep in trouble he is. It seems like an adventure as he outlasts all the others who went scrambling for their cars when the rain came &mdash; the fishermen, cyclists, the hand-holding teenagers.</p>
		<p>Timothy drinks his dinner and falls to sleep in his rain gear under the canopy of a wet tree.</p>
		<p>It&rsquo;s the booze that started this mess.</p>
		<p>Last spring, Timothy walked into mental health court, sent there for deranged and drunken behavior that culminated in his arrest for spitting on a light-rail station security guard. It was a form of probation that required him to get mental health treatment.</p>
		<p>But after weeks of failed drug tests &mdash; despite the frozen urine he kept in box of White Castle hamburgers and carried with him on his bicycle to drug tests &mdash; he was told he had 24 hours to pack up his apartment for rehab.</p>
		<p>Timothy was already on the manic side of his bipolar disorder, so the news sent him spinning.</p>

		</div>

		<p>He had to pack everything he owned out of his studio apartment &mdash; one strewn with the works of Socrates and comic books, and decorated with posters of Kim Basinger and random philosophical thoughts scrawled on paper pinned to the walls. He had to smoke the rest of his crystal meth.</p>
		<p>Timothy walked and talked in circles. He lit his meth pipe and blew smoke rings into the mirror on the wall. He stacked his best vinyls, including the Beatles&rsquo; &ldquo;Abbey Road,&rdquo; tied them in a bundle, and ran out in the rain to sell them to a record store. He tore apart his apartment looking for a suitcase.</p>
		<p>The floor was littered with dumbells, dirty socks and a law textbook. The kitchen sink was overflowing with dirty dishes. Bagels and Ramen noodles were the only food.</p>
		<p>A sign on his wall said: &ldquo;I am not like the others.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>That day, his grandmother, Fern Bechtel, &ldquo;died inside&rdquo; when she saw the apartment, which looked nothing like it had six months earlier when she helped him move in. She sat in the corner, watching him unravel, thanking God he was going to rehab before the drugs killed him.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he would make it through this,&rdquo; she said, poking her head in the kitchen and seeing the mess. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t Tim. How can 30 days change 28 years?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Timothy is a gourmet chef, can julienne carrots with the flick of a knife and whip up parmesan risotto without a recipe. He wears gel in his short light-brown hair, and sweater vests and bow ties when he is job hunting or going to court.</p>
		<p>His grandmother is speechless.</p>
		<p>She weeps as he gets high.</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">Troubled childhood</h3>

		<p class="lead">Something was wrong with Timothy&rsquo;s brain before he even started school.</p>
		<p>In kindergarten, a doctor recommended he take attention-deficit disorder medication. The boy was always running wild, wanted to know &ldquo;everything about everybody and about the world and how it worked,&rdquo; remembered his grandmother.</p>
		<p>He also was the most loving of her grandchildren, caring for an uncle in a wheelchair. His grandparents thought he was brilliant, especially with a computer or an Erector set. Timothy was a loner, and they paid for karate lessons in the hopes he would find friends. It didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
		<p>Timothy&rsquo;s parents, who divorced when he was a preschooler, were alcoholics, he said. Nowadays, he speaks little to his dad, who lives in Denver, and his mother lives in Oregon.</p>
		<p>Since childhood, he has been medicated: first Ritalin, then Wellbutrin and, most recently, Depakote to control the bipolar swings between stay-in-bed-for-days depression and freaking-out mania that sends his thoughts spinning so fast that he can&rsquo;t capture them. He doesn&rsquo;t like how he feels on prescription drugs, though. He is lured by the immediate calming and euphoric effects of alcohol, meth, cocaine and heroin.</p>
		<p>After high school in Bend, Ore., Timothy went to culinary school for a year, then moved to Denver and got a job at Rioja, one of the city&rsquo;s most-respected restaurants in Lower Downtown. But it didn&rsquo;t last, probably because Timothy told professional chefs how to cook. He couldn&rsquo;t filter his words before they came flying out of his mouth.</p>
		<p>There was a long string of jobs. A year-long stint at a Lakewood pizza joint was the longest. Then another culinary school in Keystone that, as Timothy puts it, didn&rsquo;t last because there was &ldquo;too much cocaine, booze, Australians and Brazilians.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>He worked at King Soopers for nearly a year, a job that ended after he gave his boss a box of bullets for Christmas. It wasn&rsquo;t a threat, Timothy says. It was a &ldquo;creative gift,&rdquo; one he thought his outdoorsy boss would appreciate.</p>

		<p>Timothy was drinking heavily one night in April 2012 and came to his grandmother&rsquo;s house combative and &ldquo;totally loaded&rdquo; on alcohol. She asked him to leave. Walking drunk, he stepped into traffic at South Wadsworth Boulevard and West Belleview Avenue and was struck by a Cadillac SUV. The crash broke five ribs and fractured his pelvis and two vertebrae. It also gave him a head injury, which he says made his mental state worse. Timothy spent months hospitalized and in a recovery center.</p>
		<p>He says he stayed sober for 18 months, until Father&rsquo;s Day 2013, when he was angry at his dad and drank two beers.</p>
		<p>It soon turned into &ldquo;total relapse.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>On another night of drunken stupor, after &ldquo;beers and beers and beers,&rdquo; Timothy stumbled out of a club and was stopped by a security officer at a light-rail station. He spit in the man&rsquo;s face.</p>
		<p>Timothy was charged with obstruction, and instead of jail time, he was offered a spot in Denver County&rsquo;s Court to Community program for offenders with mental illness. Through the program, he was linked with a case manager at the Mental Health Center of Denver and started therapy.</p>
		<p>When his mood was up, he applied for jobs. He went through them like tissue &mdash; at a hardware store and then signing people up for government-funded cellphones.</p>
		<p>And when he was down, he stayed in bed for days straight, chain smoking without getting out of bed, burning holes in his sheets.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I still feel terribly lonely,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve alienated myself for 29 years. But I&rsquo;m still feeling wild inside.&rdquo;</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">Struggle to stay sober</h3>

		<p class="lead">Twenty-one days sober.</p>
		<p>Timothy had one or two great runs of sobriety while living at the rehab group home for people with mental illness and substance abuse, once staying clean three weeks straight.</p>
		<p>This was after the time he walked to the motel next door and ended up smoking meth, and after the time he and another resident went to a liquor store for rum and Coke and &mdash; &ldquo;no joke&rdquo; &mdash; ended up finding a bag of cocaine on the ground, which led to a nighttime binge on heroin and cocaine. They polished it off with methadone the next day.</p>
		<p>During his month in rehab, he was required to show up in court every Thursday afternoon with the rest of the Court to Community offenders with mental illness.</p>
		<p>One week last summer, as Timothy read &ldquo;Leadership Secrets of Attila the Hun&rdquo; before his court appearance, he was proud of his sobriety and having avoided a near-breakdown. He ran into a &ldquo;dude&rdquo; on the bus who used to smoke meth with him, but Timothy stayed on the bus and rode it all the way back to the group home instead of getting off with his old friend.</p>
		<p>Timothy alternates between calling therapy a waste of time &mdash; complaining he&rsquo;s treated like a guinea pig &mdash; and a benefit that is helping him sort out his mind. The judge asks him to keep a journal on a notebook in his back pocket, to write in it whenever he is about to act on impulse.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m habitually unsuccessful in my jobs, my relationships. I&rsquo;d rather choose the path of most resistance,&rdquo; Timothy says.</p>
		<p>He is fighting with the psychiatrist from the mental health center about her diagnosis and medication. He had been taking Depakote but didn&rsquo;t like how it made him feel. Now he refuses to take anything. And he&rsquo;s angrier, more volatile, on edge.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;You need to take your medication as it&rsquo;s prescribed to you,&rdquo; Judge Johnny Barajas tells him. &ldquo;You seem more disorganized than you were two weeks ago.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve been disorganized for years now,&rdquo; Timothy says.</p>
		<p>As time passes, he seems crazed by the detox and agitated by life in the group home.</p>
		<p>Timothy loses his bed at the rehab house within two months.</p>
		<p>Again, it was his mouth.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I was questioning their psychotherapy, mostly because I felt like I wasn&rsquo;t getting the therapy that I was voluntarily signed up for. They shifted blame and responsibility to me.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Soon after, Timothy asks the judge to release him from the Court to Community program.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I could order mental health treatment, but I&rsquo;m going to leave that up to you,&rdquo; the judge tells him. &ldquo;Good luck.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The only good thing to come out of his four weeks at rehab, Timothy says, is that he&rsquo;s &ldquo;off the tweak,&rdquo; meaning meth. &ldquo;They just wrote (expletive) about me that soiled my name. They were constantly minimizing me.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>He goes to stay with friends, where there is &ldquo;too much booze and too many cokeheads.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Timothy is drinking again within days. He stays off the &ldquo;tweak&rdquo; for a couple more weeks.</p>
		<p>Living with friends turns into a meth fest. He fights with his grandmother, who cries because he has been kicked out of rehab. He retreats to the woods.</p>
		<p>This is how he ended up camped out beside a fishing pond in Littleton.</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">Homeless and alone</h3>

		<p class="lead">Timothy spit on a Lexus because the driver cut him off on his bicycle, on which the water bottle holder holds a paper coffee cup of bourbon.</p>
		<p>Already thin, he has lost 15 pounds in the last two months. His face is scruffy. In rare form, he has no hair gel to muss his light-brown hair. It&rsquo;s the middle of a rainy September afternoon, and he is drinking bourbon as he sits on a Starbucks patio, chain smoking.</p>
		<p>He has slept outside, most recently in the woods off Morrison Road, for months. The &ldquo;cleanse&rdquo; in Littleton turned into nights sleeping in an extra room he rented from an acquaintance or on an air mattress at his grandmother&rsquo;s apartment. Soon, he alienated his friends and didn&rsquo;t want to hear his grandmother&rsquo;s advice.</p>
		<p>Now he has a camp out in the weeds.</p>

		<p>He has so many plans in his head that he can&rsquo;t act on any of them. He wants a job, but not washing dishes. He didn&rsquo;t get a job in the kitchen at his grandmother&rsquo;s assisted-living center after a background check turned up his arrest history. He needs an apartment. And money. And a new gearshift for his bike. A new life plan.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I just have several hundred ideas at any given moment,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know which direction to take. I am not in a hurry to get nowhere. I am in a hurry to get somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>One of his ideas is to become a &ldquo;real bum,&rdquo; he says, partly joking.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I want to make a sign, but it really takes some audacity to be a bum like that.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>He found a job at a car wash. He lasted three days and stopped showing up. He was kicked out of his campsite by the man who owns the property.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m lost in this sea of cars and fuel and lack of prosperity,&rdquo; Timothy says.</p>
		<p>A few weeks later, on a day in October, Timothy shows up at his grandmother&rsquo;s assisted-living center on his bicycle. He is cold, exhausted and starving. He sleeps for three days. She stuffs him with scrambled eggs, twice-baked potatoes and pizza.</p>
		<p>On the third night, Fern sits on the edge of her grandson&rsquo;s air mattress and tells him he can&rsquo;t go on living like this.</p>
		<p>Timothy admits he thinks about how he could hang himself. Thinks about it often.</p>
		<p>In the morning, Fern drives him to Littleton Adventist Hospital and asks for help. She tells them Timothy needs in-patient psychiatric care, that he is planning how to die.</p>
		<p>His stay at the emergency room lasts about five hours. They send him away with a list of mental health clinics.</p>
		<p>It&rsquo;s back to the streets. Another binge.</p>

		<p>He buys a Tigger suit, to &ldquo;spread cheer.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Timothy is arrested, in the tiger outfit, for spray-painting garbage cans and the columns of a house, trying to &ldquo;beautify&rdquo; the world. Denver police put his photo on their Facebook page under &ldquo;What in the Wednesday?&rdquo; happenings, letting the public ridicule him in the online comments.</p>
		<p>A few days later, while out on bond, Timothy is a &ldquo;bit toasty&rdquo; from bourbon and pot as he strolls downtown, flinging the tiger tail over his shoulder. He makes &ldquo;so many kids happy&rdquo; and earns $10.</p>
		<p>He&rsquo;s arrested for disturbing the peace outside the Coalition for the Homeless, where he was headed for his first psychiatric appointment there.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I was like this ninja Halloween mascot, in my mind,&rdquo; he says in an interview at jail. &ldquo;I was having disassociations.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>This time, Timothy could end up with a longer jail sentence. The same judge who released him from the Court to Community program orders a mental health evaluation. Judge Barajas visits Timothy in jail and convinces him to start anti-anxiety medication.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Judge Barajas says it&rsquo;s obvious I have issues,&rdquo; Timothy says. &ldquo;Judge Barajas needs to take it from Lady Gaga: We are born this way.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>In jail, Timothy plans to read, write and &ldquo;pontificate the residue.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I saw a beautiful sunrise today,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go through these waves of inspiration. I&rsquo;ve been inspired for a while.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>His grandmother is crying again when she sees him in court, facing a felony criminal mischief charge. But at least she knows where he is for a while.</p>
		<p>This is the worst she has ever seen him. Fern refuses to give up on her grandson.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I live in fear that he will end his life,&rdquo; says Fern, her voice cracking. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t sleep at night. Nothing worse in this world than to be all alone, I think.&rdquo;</p>

			<h1><span class="titlepart">Edna</span> Turned around by treatment, helping others</h1>
		</div>
		<p class="lead">It&rsquo;s a suffocatingly hot summer day as downtown workers rush along 16th Street Mall on midmorning coffee runs. Amid them, Edna Abraham Gezahegne approaches a man in dirty jeans who is dozing off with his head on a black suitcase.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Can I buy you breakfast?&rdquo; she asks, her white purse slung over her shoulder, sleek black hair down her back.</p>
		<p>As they eat breakfast burritos and hash browns, Edna gives the man a card that says &ldquo;God loves you&rdquo; and phone numbers for shelters and mental health services.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to continue living the way you are,&rdquo; she tells him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll wear yourself out.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>She would know.</p>
		<p>Edna, 39, spent years on the streets of Denver and San Francisco. She was hospitalized 15 times on mental health holds because of paranoid schizophrenia. Each time, she was out within two weeks and stopped taking medication soon after.</p>
		<p>Until the last time.</p>
		<p>Edna&rsquo;s final, two-month hospitalization in 2009 was long enough to change her life. It sunk in that the medication helped and the doctors weren&rsquo;t trying to kill her.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I realized how off I was. I wasted 10 years for nothing,&rdquo; she said.</p>
		<p>By the time she was recovering, though, her parents had already adopted her two children because she had not been well enough to take care of them for years.</p>
		<p>Edna was unstable for much of her 20s. She once went to the airport with the intention of flying to her family&rsquo;s native Ethiopia without a ticket or a passport. She picked up an airport phone and shouted &ldquo;code yellow.&rdquo; Next thing she knew, Edna was surrounded by three police officers and taken to a hospital.</p>
		<p>More than once, she was taken to the hospital by police from a Hilton hotel lobby in San Francisco where she liked to get water and admire the art.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It sucks to think you are OK but you are not and everybody else knows it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It feels like everybody is against you. The illness itself was blocking my head from realizing I was sick.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Edna now works at Arapahoe-Douglas Mental Health Network as a peer specialist. As a &ldquo;hobby,&rdquo; she walks downtown passing out chicken sandwiches to the homeless and offering to help people find mental health treatment.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we are all supposed to do,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We are humans. People need people.&rdquo;</p>

		<p class="lead">The door of the Denver courtroom bursts open and everyone turns to stare at Christopher White, who is chanting louder than the hip-hop in his earbuds as he strides to the podium.</p>
		<p>His voice is hoarse. His eyes are wide and bloodshot. He is using a half-empty water bottle like a microphone. His punctuated chanting makes no sense.</p>
		<p>This stint out of jail has lasted only three days.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m guessing you are not taking your medication,&rdquo; says Denver County Judge Johnny Barajas, who runs this Court to Community program for people with mental illness. &ldquo;Do you want to continue with the program?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I am the program,&rdquo; Christopher shouts.</p>
		<p>He was late, arriving just before the judge issued an arrest warrant, because he&rsquo;s &ldquo;on God&rsquo;s time.&rdquo; The voice of Jesus tells him to walk to the 16th Street Mall and chant, so that is what he has done for the last three days.</p>

		<p>Christopher, 29, who has schizophrenia, is what the criminal justice system terms a &ldquo;frequent flyer.&rdquo; He has been to jail more than 30 times &mdash; for disturbing the peace, trespassing, perpetually violating a court order to stay off the mall.</p>
		<p>That&rsquo;s why he was sent here, to a courtroom that often seems more like therapy than punishment. &ldquo;Therapeutic jurisprudence,&rdquo; they call it.</p>
		<p>Those facing the most serious charges in state court are likely to end up in prison, possibly in a mental health unit. Inmates who are locked up for misdemeanor offenses might end up on probation through Court to Community, where the goal is that treatment will keep them from re-offending. Yet only a portion of those who could benefit from the program are given a spot.</p>
		<p>Each Thursday afternoon, courtroom 3H begins with a song &mdash; rock or reggae or calypso &mdash; chosen by Judge Barajas. The judge, who has a bright blue vase of vibrant flowers on his bench, writes the names of the defendants who made the &ldquo;honor roll&rdquo; by taking their medication, avoiding street drugs, attending therapy sessions and staying out of jail.</p>
		<p>One by one, they step to the podium and tell the judge about their week. He raises or lowers their grades, and they are allowed to choose from a basket of fruit snacks, potato chips and candy bars as they leave. About half graduate from the program in two years; the other half drop out or pick up new charges that land them behind bars.</p>
		<p>Christopher is not one of the success stories; he will not make it to graduation.</p>
		<p>After his courtroom spectacle, he continues chanting as he rambles through downtown Denver, sloshing through the center of the fountain at Civic Center park in his jeans and disrupting Broadway traffic as he crosses without even a glance. He has 107.5 FM blasting in his ears, but his shouting has nothing to do with the music. &ldquo;Let ... me ... explain ... to ... you,&rdquo; he yells, stopping to kneel and pray at every street sign with a symbol.</p>
		<p>People stare.</p>

				</div>
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>The judge told him to go back to the motel where he is staying. &ldquo;Do you have medicine? Please take it,&rdquo; Barajas said.</p>
		<p>But Christopher says God wants him to walk and talk. A Colorado Coalition for the Homeless caseworker who followed him out of the courthouse calls Denver police for a welfare check, and two officers step from a squad car in Civic Center park to ask Christopher if he&rsquo;s OK. &ldquo;Do you want to see a doctor?&rdquo; one asks.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I am the doctor,&rdquo; Christopher answers.</p>
		<p>The officers say they have no legal reason to arrest him or take him to the hospital. This time. He is not suicidal or homicidal. No one has accused him of disturbing the peace.</p>
		<p>It is two more days before Christopher is arrested again and sent to jail, this time for trespassing on the mall.</p>
		<p>A month later, Christopher is released from Court to Community and from jail. The judge questioned his mental competency and ordered an evaluation, but it was never done. The charge was dropped and treatment ended.</p>
		<p>Christopher goes back to the streets, where he scrounges for others&rsquo; half-eaten and discarded food and naps in a chlorine-scented brick alcove outside the Denver Athletic Club.</p>

		<p class="lead">George Brady has a thing for weed.</p>
		<p>It relaxes his mind, he says, so he smokes it even though the judge, his caseworker and his therapist keep telling him it&rsquo;s messing with his medication for schizoaffective disorder. He thinks it gives him clarity, but to everyone else, George seems more confused and forgetful when he is high.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Stay away from the marijuana,&rdquo; Judge Barajas is telling him for the 20th time at least. &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s a struggle for you, and especially the spice. Are we on the same page?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>George, 28, sees the world through an altered reality, a haze so thick it is improved but not lifted by his monthly medication shot. He hasn&rsquo;t hurt anyone but has been to jail 36 times, usually for what he terms misunderstandings. His most recent arrest was for loitering too long at a truckstop Wendy&rsquo;s. Then he was stripped of his bus pass last summer because an agent caught him trying to sell &mdash; George says give &mdash; a bus voucher to another rider.</p>
		<p>He continued to ride anyway, because how else would he get from the motel in the shadow of Interstate 70 east of Denver to his court-ordered therapy appointments downtown?</p>

		<p>It happens all the time, this total disconnect between two systems. The courts are paying for George to get therapy and stay out of jail, while the city transportation system is taking away the bus pass he uses to get to therapy.</p>
		<p>George did not realize as it was happening that he was losing his bus pass; he figures it out in court several days later. He is wide-eyed, eyebrows raised, head cocked, giving the judge one of his signature dumbfounded looks. &ldquo;RTD is everywhere! That means I can&rsquo;t be nowhere!&rdquo; he says.</p>

		<p>George is tall and softspoken. He wears his pants baggy, still with the store tags, and lets his hair grow until it is sticking up. He says he doesn&rsquo;t know what schizoaffective disorder &mdash; a combination of schizophrenia and mood disorder that alters his perception of reality &mdash; is, really. What he has, he says, is &ldquo;hard times.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like I hear imaginary voices or see imaginary people,&rdquo; he says, sitting on his motel room bed, snacking on sunflower seeds and chuckling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been feeling a lot better. I&rsquo;ve been getting rest. I&rsquo;ve been eating. I&rsquo;ve been exercising, playing basketball. I feel a lot better.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>He&rsquo;s taking Trazadone to help him sleep and a monthly shot of Invega &ldquo;to be clearing my thoughts,&rdquo; George said.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>George, like the others, came to Court to Community because the jail nurse and other staff noticed his frequent trips to jail were connected to the state of his mental health. The majority of those in the program are charged with shoplifting, trespassing, prostitution and disturbing the peace.</p>

		<p>Defendants sent to Court to Community spend 49 percent fewer days in jail after entering the program, yet 205 percent more days in the hospital for psychiatric care. Annual cost savings come out to $1,342 per person, according to the program&rsquo;s analysis.</p>
		<p>The good news though, says program director Eric Smith at the Mental Health Center of Denver, is that more hospital time typically means defendants are improving their mental health. And <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="startVideo" id="hilite2" onclick="playerScroller('video9', 'cyc3NkcTp-FYZXrWwYYYVXT4npIbmNrZ', this);">hospitalization costs level out</a> after the initial spike caused by participation in Court to Community, according to the mental health center&rsquo;s research.</p>
		<p>George&rsquo;s life was cruising along until a year into college in New Mexico, where he was studying pharmacy. His mental health deteriorated to the point he couldn&rsquo;t focus in class and dropped out, returning to Colorado. In the last six years, he has had numerous jobs, none for long. He has been homeless several times. But George is laid-back and sunny, sticking to his daily routine of checking in with his court-assigned caseworker, who manages his federal disability check.</p>
		<p>In court, George picks fruit snacks and a candy bar from the treat basket and sits down to wait for his friend Marcus; they knew each other at East High School and reconnected in Court to Community. Marcus has to produce an essay on the dangers of PCP for the judge.</p>
		<p>If George can stay out of trouble, he will graduate from the program and get off probation this month.</p>

		<p class="lead">No one is cured of mental illness, or the closely connected substance abuse, at Court to Community.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;They are not curable diseases, but we are putting them in remission,&rdquo; said Shari Lewinski, program administrator for Denver&rsquo;s behavioral health courts. &ldquo;When we first meet them, they are lost, they are confused, unkempt, angry, bitter.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;That is the most horrendous, cruelest aspect of mental illness &mdash; that it is a brain disease. Any other illness, you wouldn&rsquo;t argue with the doctor about what the treatment is. Your behavior is what is impacted by mental health, and people pass judgment on that.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Lewinski is notified when the jail or a judge finds someone they suspect is a good fit for Court to Community, which began eight years ago and was modeled after drug court programs that treat the root cause of drug-related crimes &mdash; addiction. The program was started by a former judge alarmed by seeing so many repeat defendants with mental illness in his courtroom.</p>
		<p>Inmates in the program are pushed to the front of the line for psychiatric services at the Mental Health Center of Denver or the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless, but the wait to see a psychiatrist can still take months.</p>

He was left with permanent brain damage that kept him in and out of the New Mexico state mental hospital much of his life.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Instead of the state hospitals, we have the county jail,&rdquo; Barajas said.</p>
		<p>His biggest challenge is convincing defendants to take their medication. The music, snacks, chit-chat and honor roll are meant to make his courtroom feel relaxed and tolerant. Court staff and defendants sing happy birthday to each other, applaud for a week of fulfilled commitments. Defendants beam when the judge ups their grades or puts them on the honor roll, which means they are called to the podium first and get to leave court sooner.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I doubt any of these folks got those grades in school,&rdquo; Barajas said.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;She was disheveled. She talked a mile a minute. She didn&rsquo;t have any organized thought process,&rdquo; he says of the Darcy who walked into court last spring. &ldquo;Look at her now. It&rsquo;s night and day. It&rsquo;s just a completely different human being.&rdquo;</p>

		<p class="lead">George wants to know if he has enough money left to buy a glittering faux-diamond necklace with &ldquo;Dope&rdquo; spelled in rhinestones.</p>
		<p>He already picked out a $36 pair of hiking boots, an orange-and-black sweatshirt and a &ldquo;ragtop&rdquo; shirt with a cheetah.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;If you dress nice, you feel nice, so I can&rsquo;t wait to get dressed,&rdquo; he says, ducking into a dressing room at the Gen-X store on Colfax. His mental health case manager is helping him spend his disability money, making sure he has enough left for food and rent. He buys the necklace but does not wear it to court.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;You are a smart guy,&rdquo; Lewinski tells him in court. &ldquo;I like the George who stays out of trouble.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>George has moved into an apartment and wants to start nursing classes at Emily Griffith Opportunity School. He spent a court-ordered night in jail because he can&rsquo;t stay away from marijuana. &ldquo;I got to try harder. Buckle down. Watch my surroundings,&rdquo; he says.</p>
		<p>He wasn&rsquo;t allowed to graduate on time, held back because his drug tests keep coming up positive for weed.</p>
		<p>Darcy McCarthy&rsquo;s attempts to stay sober and make it to her psychiatric appointments fell apart soon after her ex walked back into her life. After seven months without trouble, she was arrested in October after drinking and fighting with a stranger on a bus.</p>
		<p>Christopher White, who grew up in Hotchkiss and flunked out of school in fifth grade, was arrested soon after he was dismissed from the program. He spent three months in jail, in a solitary cell in the mental health unit, for trespassing again near the 16th Street Mall.</p>
		<p>During a jailhouse interview halfway through that sentence, and after about a month back on medication, Christopher talked of cracking codes of the &ldquo;purple people&rdquo; and the importance of reporting the codes to the anti-Christ who lives in an alley off Pennsylvania Street east of downtown. &ldquo;The purple people, they don&rsquo;t believe in Christ Jesus the King,&rdquo; he said, explaining that when he writes the codes, Jesus takes over his pen.</p>
		<p>He was upset his release date was Oct. 31.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared because it&rsquo;s the day of the dead,&rdquo; he said.</p>
		<p>Judge Barajas&rsquo; rotation as the head of Court to Community ended this fall, but he has kept in touch with several of his offenders, often through jail visits.</p>

		<p class="lead">Colorado prisons treat more than four times as many people with mental illness each day as all of the psychiatric hospitals in the state.</p>
		<p>The Department of Corrections, by default, is the largest mental health treatment center in Colorado. A third of inmates, 5,760 prisoners, have mental problems.</p>
		<p>In Denver, the jail &mdash; by sheer volume of &ldquo;patients&rdquo; at up to 500 per day &mdash; is the biggest provider of mental health services in the metro area. One-fifth of Denver County Jail inmates have mental illnesses.</p>
		<p>Jails and prisons are no longer warehouses holding the accused until their time is up. They are treatment centers; the Denver County Jail has three psychologists and six diversion and mental health program officers, and holds classes twice daily to teach inmates with mental illness how to function without breaking the law.</p>
		<p>It&rsquo;s expensive: Denver County spent $245,200 on anti-psychotics and other mental health drugs for jail inmates last year alone. The Department of Corrections spent $1.9 million on mental health prescriptions.</p>
		<p>Colorado also pays $2,083 per prisoner, per year to treat mental health problems, and for some of them, it&rsquo;s the first treatment they ever get.</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">Soriano&rsquo;s story</h3>

		<p class="lead">Jose Reyes Soriano&rsquo;s mother warned that someone would get hurt. She didn&rsquo;t know when or who, but she was terrified her son would snap.</p>
		<p>And when he did, with a kitchen knife in the middle of the night in her Highlands Ranch bedroom, it was like a scene from a horror movie.</p>
		<p>Soriano&rsquo;s mental troubles emerged years earlier when he began covering his bedroom windows with newspaper so no one could spy on him, Soriano&rsquo;s sister Vicenta said.</p>
		<p>Until 18, he had been an outgoing and smart student at Rangeview High School in Aurora. But after enrolling at the Community College of Denver, he became paranoid, isolating himself, trusting no one. He was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia at a drug rehab center, where his mother sent him because she was worried he was doing drugs.</p>
		<p>Soriano called police more than once &mdash; often to report a stranger was in their house about to attack him.</p>
		<p>No one was ever there.</p>
		<p>Soriano&rsquo;s mother had him evaluated at a mental health clinic, but doctors there told her he wasn&rsquo;t a threat, Vicenta said. The family had no insurance coverage for mental health, creating another layer of difficulty to find treatment.</p>
		<p>She brought him to hospital emergency rooms several times but the longest they held him was two or three days, never enough to stabilize him, Vicenta said.</p>
		<p>This went on for years.</p>
		<p>When Soriano was 22, he became convinced his stepfather was molesting Soriano&rsquo;s younger brother, who was 10. There was no proof, even after the boys&rsquo; mother had her youngest son evaluated by doctors in case there was any truth to the claim. Still, Jose Soriano continued to rail: If no one else was going to do something about this, he would.</p>
		<p>Again, his mother begged a Highlands Ranch mental health center to give him inpatient treatment. Staff said he was not eligible for inpatient treatment because he was not an immediate threat to himself or others.</p>
		<p>And then on April 1, 2005, Soriano found his little brother in bed with his mother and stepfather, where he had climbed after being awakened by a nightmare.</p>
		<p>Soriano got a kitchen knife and stabbed his stepfather twice in the torso. He bled to death on the floor.</p>
		<p>As his mother and little brother watched, Soriano then slashed his own throat, shouting that he would rather die than go to prison for the rest of his life.</p>
		<p>But he survived, was convicted of murder and sentenced to 20 years in prison.</p>
		<p>Soriano has been locked up for nine years, most of it in solitary confinement.</p>
		<p>Vicenta never knew her brother was capable of such rage. &ldquo;When someone has a mental illness it&rsquo;s really hard to tell when they are going to snap,&rdquo; she said.</p>
		<p>Soriano is scheduled to leave prison in six years. Vicenta hopes that by then, he will have received the mental health treatment his family begged for years ago.</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">Treatment for inmates evolves</h3>

		<p class="lead">Among Colorado&rsquo;s 5,760 prisoners with mental health issues, more than 1,760 are classified by prison officials as having a &ldquo;serious mental illness,&rdquo; including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or extreme depression.</p>
		<p>For some, diagnosis of mental health disorder by prison staff was the first diagnosis of their lives.</p>
		<p>The state corrections budget for mental health treatment, excluding medications, has climbed 48 percent in just five years, from $8.1 million in 2007 to $12 million last year.</p>
		<p>States are forced to spend huge amounts of money for mental health treatment in prison because for decades they have failed to invest enough in early treatment of mental health, he said. &ldquo;The money that we do have we use in a really slapdash, ineffective way,&rdquo; said John Snook, executive director of the Treatment Advocacy Center.</p>

		<p>The center supports programs that divert criminals to treatment rather than jail with this caveat: &ldquo;You can have the best mental health court in the world, but at the end of the day, you are still having to get arrested to get mental health treatment.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Colorado prison officials do not track how many of the 5,760 prisoners with mental health problems were  diagnosed in prison, but staff psychiatrists, psychologists and counselors often are the ones to first recognize problems and start treatment.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We are contributing a great amount of time to ensuring that people&rsquo;s mental well-being is addressed while they are incarcerated,&rdquo; said Kellie Wasko, deputy executive director of the corrections department.</p>
		<p>Of her 16 years in the corrections business, Wasko has watched as mental health treatment evolved into proactive therapy. Now the prison offers group therapy, pet therapy and behavior therapy developed for the chronically suicidal.</p>
		<p>Part of treatment is breaking patterns learned in childhood, mainly that kids are taught to ask for help only when they are physically hurt and bleeding.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t teach people that if you are hearing voices or if you get angry and you are having impulses, you need to call a mental health provider,&rdquo; Wasko said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very new awareness in society.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Denver County began a $40,000 annual program a few years ago to provide 30-day prescriptions to inmates who take psychotropic medications when they leave jail. Offenders can fill their prescriptions at Denver Health Medical Center, which also has nurses and mental health staff working inside the jail.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Although we do all this work while they&rsquo;re in our custody, some of it could be for not if these services don&rsquo;t <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="startVideo" id="hilite4" onclick="playerScroller('video10', 'pkdHNkcTomv2tz63fSO0KaBU5j2jkqT_', this);">continue while they are in the community</a>,&rdquo; Sheriff Elias Diggins said. &ldquo;Jail is not the place to be for someone who has a mental health condition that causes them to act out, commit crime or self-medicate. The person needs to be in a treatment center. If we want to stop the tide of rising numbers in jails and prisons across the United States, as a society we have to focus on that.&rdquo;</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">Civil commitment law</h3>

		<p class="lead">Along a sterile corridor of the state mental hospital, there is a quiet room where rhythmic ocean waves play in stereo and a lumpy bean bag sits beside a lava lamp.</p>
		<p>It&rsquo;s sensory therapy, where the criminally insane come for restoration of the mind.</p>
		<p>Kept inside the Pueblo fortress of the state psychiatric hospital are 124 people found not guilty by reason of insanity. Some are learning how to operate a cash register; some are learning how to brush their teeth.</p>
		<p>The institution also holds 167 people deemed too mentally ill to stand trial on criminal charges. They can return to face a judge and jury if and when their mental health is restored by doctors at the Colorado Mental Health Institute.</p>
		<p>The 300-acre campus, which looks half-hospital, half-prison, is where the most ill are held. The institute in Pueblo, and a Denver campus at Fort Logan, also keep about 150 patients who have not committed crimes, but are there on civil commitments &mdash; found legally unfit to function anywhere else in society.</p>
		<p>It&rsquo;s far more likely that people with mental illnesses are the victims rather than the perpetrators of crime, an oft-cited fact among mental health advocates trying to dispel fear that &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; people are scary and dangerous.</p>
		<p>They are frustrated that public conversation about improving mental health care kicks up only after a tragedy. The talk should start, they argue, with how to improve prevention and treatment at the onset of mental illness, long before catastrophe.</p>
		<p>Still, community tragedies linked with mental illness &mdash; including last December&rsquo;s murder-suicide at Arapahoe High School &mdash; have tagged Colorado as a hot spot for needed improvements in the mental health system. After years of budget cuts, the 2012 theater shooting in Aurora forced policymakers to act. Suspect James Holmes has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity; prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.</p>
		<p>Since the shooting, the legislature approved Gov. John Hickenlooper&rsquo;s plan for four mental health crisis centers around the state and Colorado&rsquo;s first statewide mental health hotline.</p>
		<p>For families like Jose Soriano&rsquo;s, who tried to get help before someone was murdered, a less stringent civil commitment law could have made the difference in preventing a tragedy, advocates for change argue.</p>
		<p>Attempts to change Colorado&rsquo;s commitment law so that doctors and relatives of those with mental illness have more power to force psychiatric treatment failed this year at the legislature. Wisconsin and Arizona have rewritten civil commitment laws so that medical professionals can hold people for treatment because they are in dire need of care, going a step beyond Colorado law.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;There is nothing that can be done right now in Colorado unless that person tries to hurt themselves or hurt somebody,&rdquo; said Snook, with the Treatment Advocacy Center. &ldquo;The minute someone is not dangerous, they are released from treatment in Colorado.&rdquo;</p>

		<p class="lead">At dawn, the shelters send them back to the streets. Or they wake up beside the river, another day to wander downtown among the workers and tourists.</p>
		<p>Two-thirds of them, the chronically homeless of Denver, have this in common: mental illness.</p>
		<p>Just one-third of those with mental illnesses are receiving treatment, based on national estimates.</p>
		<p>The causes of homelessness &mdash; job loss, family breakups, alcohol and drug abuse &mdash; often are rooted in mental illness, and treatment of mental health problems becomes even more difficult without a stable home.</p>
		<p>Housing is health care, the best form of treatment for those with mental illness living on the streets. Yet Denver has a shortage of affordable housing, leaving nonprofits and government agencies to offer a patchwork of psychiatric services to the homeless that barely reaches beyond the most severe cases.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;All of these things work together to create a feeder system into homelessness,&rdquo; said John Parvensky, president of the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless. &ldquo;Once people are on the streets, their mental health issues intensify. What might be mild anxiety becomes more significant anxiety. Depression certainly intensifies as well.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The need is far greater than nonprofits and government clinics can handle.</p>
		<p>The coalition&rsquo;s mental health clinic kept a waiting list for new patients until a few years ago. The staff threw it out when it reached 2,000 names.</p>
		<p>It was not &ldquo;kind, useful or ethical&rdquo; to tell people what number they were, and by the time someone on the wait list was up for an appointment, it usually was impossible to find them again, said psychiatric director Dr. Elizabeth Cookson. Now the psychiatric team accepts patients mostly through referrals from the coalition&rsquo;s primary-care staff. An unknown number are turned away when the clinic is full.</p>
		<p>The coalition has capped its waiting list for housing at 100 names, a dent in the thousands of homeless in the Denver metro area. There are now hundreds of people waiting, for months or years.</p>

		<p>She is steeling herself to sleep along the banks of a west Denver creek, a flattened cardboard box between her blankets and the damp grass.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared but I&rsquo;m not going to show it,&rdquo; she says, watching light raindrops splash into Lakewood Gulch and two ducks float past. Her dog, Babie, a Pekinese, is barking at men playing disc golf in the park above the embankment where she has set up camp. Syringes left by previous campers are scattered near her bed.</p>
		<p>Lisa has been homeless for nearly a year. Her dirty cheeks were streaked by the tears that fell earlier as she talked about how much she hates living in shelters and, in the case of tonight, sleeping outside when the shelter is full. She is wearing a blue bandana around her dark hair, a happy shade of bright purple nail polish on her fingers, and pajama pants on top of her jeans so they don&rsquo;t get muddy. She has a bottle of Coke and a pack of cigarettes.</p>

		<p>Lisa, 49, was diagnosed with bipolar disorder years ago, and she knows her medication isn&rsquo;t quite right &mdash; she feels depressed all the time and she is quick to &ldquo;snap&rdquo; in anger. Anxiety keeps her mind racing.</p>
		<p>But she will deal with her mental health later, when she isn&rsquo;t homeless. Her psychiatrist at the health clinic north of downtown wants to increase her anti-depressant dosage or switch medications, but Lisa refuses to mess with it while she and Babie are living on the streets. She thinks homelessness is making her mental illness worse.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;On the street, your mind does go whacked,&rdquo; she says.</p>
		<p>Lisa could have ridden the light-rail train all night, but she would have had to wake up and get off each time it reached the end of the line. Her mind and her body are too tired for that this time.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I walk all day long,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I just want to lay down and rest.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Along the creek, Lisa puts her feet inside a plastic garbage bag and pulls it up to her thighs, then snuggles with Babie and bundles herself in blankets.</p>
		<p>At first light, she loads up her black pushcart and washes up in a McDonald&rsquo;s bathroom. She takes her antidepressants with her coffee. &ldquo;These are to keep you stable,&rdquo; she says.</p>
		<p>Usually, Lisa and Babie wake up in the Volunteers of America emergency shelter for women on Elati Street about a block from the Denver County Jail. Sixty women are packed in, unrolling thin mats inches apart. Lisa wears ear plugs. She is almost always the first out the door, rolling off her mat by 5:30 a.m. and heading out to the streets for a day of walking.</p>
		<p>Lisa has a don&rsquo;t-mess-with-me glare that makes other street women keep their distance. The skin on her face is weathered from seasons spent outside in the Colorado sun and wind. She rolls her eyes about the time staff passed out bags of croutons and said they were chips, as if homeless women were so unsophisticated they wouldn&rsquo;t know the difference. But as soon as Lisa talks about her children and grandchildren, or counts the months she has been living on the streets, the tears well up. The street-tough exterior cracks.</p>
		<p>Babie is her &ldquo;heart,&rdquo; she often says, and she will turn down a hot meal or a place to sleep if the dog isn&rsquo;t allowed.</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">&ldquo;A holding ground&rdquo;</h3>

		<p class="lead">Widespread, chronic homelessness emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s, in part a result of mental institutions across the nation shutting their doors or reducing their beds. The plan was that community mental health clinics would fill the gap.</p>
		<p>Those living on the streets without help &mdash; either because they have been turned away or because they refuse to ask &mdash; stumble through the circuit of free food and crowded shelters run by the Denver Rescue Mission, Catholic Charities and Volunteers of America.</p>
		<p>Tammy Clarke, whose job at Saint Francis Center is to convince people living under overpasses and abandoned buildings to come out of hiding and accept help, says the center is a &ldquo;holding ground&rdquo; for people who aren&rsquo;t getting treatment at community mental health clinics. In two years she has sent referrals for 125 homeless people who wanted treatment from the Mental Health Center of Denver.</p>
		<p>Just five of those got appointments.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;There is a big gap in the mental health system for the homeless,&rdquo; Clarke said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in that gap.&rdquo; Those who don&rsquo;t get treatment &ldquo;give up,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The years go by and they get in trouble, go back to jail, go in and out of the hospital.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>At the Mental Health Center of Denver, needy people who want help with their mental illness dial each morning when the phones open at 8 a.m. to ask for an appointment. It can take months of hearing, &ldquo;There are no appointments left.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>This summer, the Mental Health Center of Denver changed its policy to accept every person who asks for help if they have Medicaid insurance. With the influx of Medicaid funding, the center is hiring staff as quickly as it can.</p>
		<p>Among 5,800 Denver metro homeless people surveyed this year, 34 percent reported mental illness. Those numbers have risen every year for the last four.</p>
		<p>But that is self-reported data. When homeless people are assessed for mental illness, the statistic jumps dramatically. And when considering only the category of chronically homeless and single, psychiatrists believe 65 to 70 percent is most accurate, according to the homeless coalition.</p>
		<p>On average, people with severe mental illness die 25 years earlier, and the homeless die 31 years sooner than people with homes.</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">Another homeless winter?</h3>

		<p class="lead">Lisa pinpoints the moment her life shattered as the one that a drunken driver celebrating his 21st birthday slammed into her car in 2001. She had just finished her shift as a clerk at Motel 6 and was on her way to pick up her kids from the babysitter.</p>
		<p>She recovered, after her spine was fused back together with titanium rods, but was in such pain and on so many painkillers she couldn&rsquo;t work. She lost her job and has been living on a monthly disability check &mdash; for mental and physical issues &mdash; since 2003. Her unpaid medical bills totaled $48,000.</p>
		<p>Lisa thought she was renting to own her townhouse, but she says the paperwork the owners had her sign was not legitimate, and when she lost the house, she had just three days to move out. The news was so devastating, her mental state so fragile, that she slit her wrists in a suicide attempt. Her son brought her to the emergency room, where she was kept on a 72-hour psychiatric hold.</p>

		<p>In her first months as a homeless person, Lisa slept in a friend&rsquo;s backyard and had to go to the bathroom in an alley. Then she and Babie moved into her storage unit several miles north of the city. They stayed almost three months, until they were discovered, and Lisa moved to the streets downtown. Now she pushes a walker around Denver, a black cart packed high with pajamas, cans of soup, Pepsi, coffee and Babie&rsquo;s blue water dish marked with his name in black.</p>
		<p>Lisa is proud when she talks about her two sons and a daughter, plus 13 grandchildren. She can&rsquo;t live with any of them because, she says, &ldquo;they have their own lives.&rdquo; One son manages a Walgreens, though he won&rsquo;t tell her which one.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Who would want to see their mom like this, pushing a cart?&rdquo; she asks, the tears beginning to flow.</p>
		<p>Lisa has been on the Coalition for the Homeless&rsquo; housing waiting list for nearly a year. &ldquo;Is it going to be another winter that me and Babie will be homeless again?&rdquo;</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">Housing first, then treatment</h3>

		<p class="lead">A shift in philosophy on who should get housing is taking hold across the country, including here. The concept is that housing is health care, and the people with the most need &mdash; those living on the streets with mental or physical disabilities &mdash; should get housing even before proving they are stable or medicated or agreeing to participate in therapy. It&rsquo;s a shift from thinking that the people who have proved they are ready, not the ones who are the most dire, should top the list.</p>
		<p>The Denver &ldquo;housing first&rdquo; program pulls people directly off the streets and into housing, then gives them &ldquo;wrap-around&rdquo; health care, substance abuse and psychiatric services along the way. Turns out the program saves an average of $31,000 per person in emergency room, health care and detox costs, according to a coalition study.</p>
		<p>The coalition opened its 17th building last summer a few blocks north of downtown, and now houses more than 900 people who once lived on the streets. There are thousands more who could benefit, if housing were available.</p>
		<p>Tension between advocates for the homeless and the business community that helped turn Lower Downtown into a hot spot of chic lofts and breweries is at an all-time high. Numerous nonprofits and government agencies keep waiting lists for federal subsidized housing vouchers, but most landlords won&rsquo;t accept them. When the renters&rsquo; market is tight, landlords choose employed, stable applicants instead of homeless people with mental illnesses.</p>
		<p>Much of the housing that exists for people with a mental illness so debilitating they cannot work is called &ldquo;supportive housing,&rdquo; meaning it comes with a case manager who lives in the building and knows each tenant&rsquo;s particular issues. The strategy has kept 95 percent of tenants in their apartments for more than a year, a feat among a population much more likely to face eviction.</p>
		<p>Mental illness is the reason many of the coalition&rsquo;s residents ended up homeless in the first place. Their previous landlords evicted them for their odd behavior &mdash; for damaging walls because paranoia convinced them their neighbors were spying on them or for scaring other residents.</p>
		<p>One homeless man with a mental illness spent his days collecting cans, and he continued to collect them when he moved into a coalition-owned apartment. Soon an entire room was filled with dirty pop and beer cans, bug magnets. Instead of evicting him, though, the case manager at the apartment building gave the man a locked garbage can in the garage to keep his cans.</p>
		<p>Collecting cans wasn&rsquo;t a hobby or a job to the man. &ldquo;It was his existence. It was who he was. It was worth becoming homeless again, it was that strong,&rdquo; said Tim Marshall, the coalition&rsquo;s vice president of residential operations and services.</p>
		<p>Marshall estimates that housed people are five times as likely to achieve mental stability. &ldquo;Remembering to take your medication is not high on your list of priorities&rdquo; when you are cold, hungry and looking for a place to sleep, he said.</p>
		<p>Marshall gets mad when he considers that some people think homeless people who are mentally ill want to live outside. &ldquo;Nobody wants to lose their toes to frostbite,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;To say they are choosing to do that is just sad.&rdquo;</p>

		<p class="lead">Tears spring from Lisa&rsquo;s brown eyes the second she hears she will get a subsidized apartment. She has been homeless 13 months.</p>
		<p>When she turns her own key and pushes open the door, Babie tucked in her arms, Lisa squeals. &ldquo;This is beautiful! We got a toilet. We got our own bathtub,&rdquo; she tells her dog. &ldquo;Look Boo-Boo. This is where you will live.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Then she buries her face in his neck and sobs.</p>
		<p>The building is the new Stout Street Lofts, the coalition&rsquo;s 17th housing project. Lisa will pay 30 percent of her annual income, $8,652 in disability checks, to live in her own apartment. She qualifies as a resident because she is chronically homeless and has a documented mental illness. &ldquo;As long as I&rsquo;m off the street, I&rsquo;ll do anything,&rdquo; Lisa says when she finds out she will have to report to a case manager.</p>
		<p>In her new place, Lisa&rsquo;s first plan is to take a hot bath and &ldquo;sleep for days.&rdquo; Then she wants to invite her family for dinner. She will get her &ldquo;mental health back in order.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>She will build a little shrine to remember her days on the streets. It will contain a hat she found in the gutter, a highlighter marker and a pink silk flower that she picked up off the ground and wrote Babie&rsquo;s name near a petal.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;This was my first and last time being homeless. That&rsquo;s it. No more.&rdquo;</p>

		<p class="lead">&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t none of us got here by taxi,&rdquo; say Arlin Kelly, one of 25 women who live at Irving Street Women&rsquo;s Residence, a Volunteers of America home for chronically homeless women with mental illness.</p>
		<p>The average stay at the Denver house &mdash; which has rocking chairs on the front porch and three meals a day &mdash; is about two years, long enough for most women to become mentally stable and find their own apartments.</p>
		<p>Irving Street residents receive treatment through mental health clinics, and therapists visit the house. About 60 percent of the women leave successful.</p>
		<p>For most, it is the first home they&rsquo;ve had in years without a time limit, without curfews or stringent rules, a place full of second chances.</p>
		<p>The women who live in the renovated dorm-style home, a couple of blocks from Federal Boulevard, pay 30 percent of their income, which for some is nothing. Many receive federal disability checks, typically about $700 or so per month.</p>
		<p>The home receives most of its funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Federal policymakers have elected not to open any other safe havens, instead putting money toward subsidized housing options for individuals and families.</p>

		<p>The wait list to move into Irving Street is months long. The goal is that the women get therapy, gain mental stability and find their own apartments.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been through so many more things than any of us can imagine,&rdquo; said Angel Hurtado, a <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="startVideo" id="hilite5" onclick="playerScroller('video19', 'wxNWJlcTodDa4sXZyVRhPTQ2KftBFn6m', this);">Volunteers of America director</a>. &ldquo;It gives them time to focus on what caused homelessness in the first place. They have been victims, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean they have to stay victims.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>For these women, two years is a luxury.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Two years feels like a lifetime after what we&rsquo;ve been through,&rdquo; says Kelly, waiting to go inside for a communal dinner of meatloaf, beans, corn bread, carrots and spinach.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;By the time we got here, we were so ground down by mental illness, by surviving one day after the next, the same horror show,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;This place, this is like landing in Candyland. I wake up every morning and I&rsquo;m happy.&rdquo;</p>

			<h1><span class="titlepart">Arlin Kelly</span> 53, depression and anxiety</h1>
		</div>
		<p class="lead">Arlin Kelly&rsquo;s rock bottom was crawling out of a doghouse.</p>
		<p>She had squeezed herself inside because it was the only shelter she could find on a snowy night. In the morning, brushing the dog hair off of her clothes, her self-disgust was so tangible it felt like physical pain. Then the owner of the doghouse yelled at her for making his dog sleep in the cold.</p>
		<p>How had her life come to this? She had been, in her words, a &ldquo;50-year-old white lady from the suburbs.&rdquo; What did she know about surviving homeless?</p>
		<p>In the simplest of explanations, Arlin fell so far because she had been battling mental illness for decades and methamphetamine was the medicine she prescribed herself.</p>
		<p>She wasn&rsquo;t diagnosed, despite almost lifelong bouts with depression and anxiety, until she met a probation officer who sent her for a psychiatric evaluation in 2010. The diagnosis: extreme anxiety disorder, chronic and severe depression and borderline personality disorder.</p>
		<p>Arlin, 53, is a robust woman with white hair shocked red at the tips. Life has brought her three grown children, two ex-husbands, a host of mental and physical problems and just recently, a chance to restore her dignity.</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">&ldquo;I ran&rdquo;</h3>

		<p class="lead">The collapse of Arlin&rsquo;s life as she had known it, the point when it began to &ldquo;swirl the bowl,&rdquo; started in February 2010 when her mother, her best friend, was diagnosed with terminal cancer. She &ldquo;felt the world shift.&rdquo; Only days later, her 35-year &ldquo;love affair&rdquo; with meth bit her in the backside when she sold it to an undercover police officer.</p>
		<p>Arlin went to jail. After four months, a judge agreed to let her out on emergency bail to see her mother before she died.</p>
		<p>She was released the next day. Her mother was already dead.</p>
		<p>Arlin had missed saying goodbye by a few hours. She will never get over it.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;My ex-husband and my oldest son still haven&rsquo;t spoken to me since then. Because when she needed me most, I wasn&rsquo;t there.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Arlin lived in her mother&rsquo;s house for a few months, but couldn&rsquo;t afford the rent and was evicted. She and her grown daughter left with the clothes on their backs and her mother&rsquo;s six cats and one dog, animals she had promised her mother on her death bed that she would keep.</p>
		<p>Even homeless, she managed — at first — to keep up with her probation. But keeping the animals on the streets became too much. The no-kill shelter wouldn&rsquo;t take them, so she gave them to another shelter. All but two were deemed unadoptable.</p>
		<p>That broke her.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I basically had a meltdown. I ran.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>She walked the streets by day and found a place, a shelter or a tree, to rest at night. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t live with that level of pain. My spirit was in so much pain.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>She knew she was drowning. She asked for help at a mental health clinic. The wait was six months at least.</p>
		<p>On Christmas Eve, when she was staying with a friend, she tried to hang herself. She ended up at University Hospital, where she was admitted on a psychiatric hold. Arlin spent three days at Porter Hospital, and was discharged with prescriptions for depression and anxiety.</p>
		<p>After more health problems, including a diagnosis of a rare bleeding brain disease that causes extreme headaches, Arlin stayed in a respite bed at the Samaritan House homeless shelter and later a nursing home.</p>
		<p>Then she got the call from Irving Street.</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">Finding her dignity</h3>

		<p class="lead">Arlin is sitting in a rocking chair on the front porch. This is where she usually is, chain smoking like nobody&rsquo;s business and rocking so vigorously the chair inches across the front porch until it is clipped by the opening of the front door. She cannot hold still.</p>
		<p>If no one is around to chat, Arlin is buried in a bodice-ripper romance or a mystery novel. She reads like a fiend.</p>
		<p>And she writes.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember being the mother I dreamt of always being,&rdquo; says one of her journal entries. &ldquo;Nor do I recall being the daughter my mother deserved. I don&rsquo;t remember all the summers of my childhood or all the beatings I endured.&rdquo;</p>

				</div>
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>Each morning, she opens her bedroom door and shuffles out in her pajamas, headed for the porch to light the first cigarette of the day with her newfound friends.</p>
		<p>Among friends who understood where she had been, Arlin found a new peace of mind and the courage to try living on her own again. This fall, she moved into her own apartment.</p>
		<p>She will do almost anything to never live on the streets again.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;You are always hungry. You are always dirty. And people stop looking at you like you are human. I went from being the happiest person I knew to being something that people scooted away from, was afraid I would talk to your kids.&rdquo;</p>

									<p>She longs for the wealth she says she has lost. Danielle, 65, is the most put-together woman at the Irving Street home for formerly homeless women with mental illness. She is adorned in gold and silver bracelets and rings, sparkly earrings, heeled boots and bright red lips. Her perfume is as strong as her Polish accent.</p>
									<p>&ldquo;I like Chardonnay. I have an antique opener. Now I don&rsquo;t even have 63 cents to buy coffee.&rdquo;</p>
									<p>Her life story is hard to follow.</p>
									<p>She says she had open credit at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. She was once a model pictured in Vogue magazine. She lost her fortune when she got divorced 17 years ago.</p>
									<p>Danielle says she had a nervous breakdown and spent a time homeless and living in shelters, but the details are sketchy. She is estranged from her son. &ldquo;I have Valium. I refuse to take drugs.&rdquo;</p>
									<p>She lasted at Irving Street only a few months. After numerous police visits, the last straw for staff was when Danielle threatened another resident with a butter knife.</p>
									<p>Danielle went back to living on the streets in August, riding the bus, sleeping at an emergency shelter for women downtown. She recently found a subsidized apartment to rent.</p>

									<p>Mary Gail Rivera watched her father stab her mother. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t breathe. I didn&rsquo;t know what I was going to do. I thought I was going to die.&rdquo;</p>
									<p>She was 4 or 5 years old then, and now, at 63, she still has anxiety attacks if &ldquo;someone starts anything.&rdquo; She avoids all confrontation. She hates to fight.</p>
									<p>&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s wrong with me &mdash; I hold everything in and I get an anxiety attack.&rdquo;</p>
									<p>Mary, who grew up in San Juan Capistrano, Calif., and sold mistletoe to make money as a child, has been a cook, a dishwasher, a landscaper, a waitress. She is also an artist, creating vibrant paintings that hang in the Irving Street home where she moved several months ago.</p>
									<p>Mary was homeless three times before finding a place at Irving Street, staying in shelters or living with friends. Without medication for her anxiety, she felt jumpy and afraid most of the time. And the things she saw living on the streets only intensified her feelings.</p>
									<p>While staying at the Samaritan House shelter in Denver, she witnessed a couple kicking and hitting each other &mdash; a fight that resulted in a stabbing. Mary saw it from a rooftop, and it brought on a panic attack.</p>
									<p>&ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t like staying with anybody,&rdquo; she said.</p>
									<p>At Irving Street, she doesn&rsquo;t feel so &ldquo;uptight&rdquo; and &ldquo;agitated.&rdquo; When she feels anxious, she takes a nap or a walk to clear her head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think right. I guess that&rsquo;s why I make bad choices.&rdquo;</p>
									<p>Mary spends her days painting sunsets and seascapes that remind her of the California coast. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think about anything else when I paint.&rdquo;</p>

									<p>The 24-year-old is a free spirit, with long, flowing hair and hippie clothes. She is studying to become a massage therapist and three years ago hitched a ride to Colorado from a stranger at an Arby&rsquo;s in Wyoming.</p>
									<p>Ashley, who grew up in Wyoming, says she had a rough childhood, was abused and spent her teenage years in pain from endometriosis. Therapists had told her she had bipolar disorder. Then they changed the diagnosis to &ldquo;behavioral problems&rdquo; and, most recently, post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>
									<p>She lived in her Chevy Impala for a summer and has camped out, lived in motels and couch-surfed before moving to Irving Street.</p>
									<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a lot of weird places,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This place has been the best place I&rsquo;ve been so far.&rdquo;</p>

									<p>That was the worst of it. &ldquo;At the time, the logic piece of my brain wasn&rsquo;t working,&rdquo; said Kathy, 40.</p>
									<p>With therapy, Kathy has learned to recognize the signs that she is about to have a psychotic break. Things become confused. Sudoku, which normally calms her, can suddenly make no sense to her.</p>
									<p>Kathy was first diagnosed with mental illness in 2011, after she had been evicted, was homeless and on probation for a methamphetamine conviction. A psychiatrist with the probation department told her she has bipolar disorder with psychotic features.</p>
									<p>She took meth to self-medicate her swings of mania followed by dark days of depression, including thoughts of killing herself. Mental illness runs in Kathy&rsquo;s family &mdash; her mom has schizophrenia and her dad killed himself.</p>
									<p>After living in the Samaritan House shelter, and even camping out in a field, Kathy received a bed at Irving Street. She lived at the women&rsquo;s home for a year and a half before getting her own apartment last summer.</p>
									<p>&ldquo;It was a huge relief coming to Irving Street. I wasn&rsquo;t in fight or flight anymore. I didn&rsquo;t have to worry about where to stay the next day.&rdquo;</p>
									<p>Kathy said she was in &ldquo;no shape&rdquo; to live on her own when she arrived at Irving Street; she spent the first few months &ldquo;crawling out of her skin&rdquo; because she couldn&rsquo;t relax. But with therapy, medication and a place to put the pieces back together, she learned how to live on her own again.</p>
									<p>&ldquo;Being able to do things on my time has been a huge, wonderful relief to me,&rdquo; Kathy said.</p>
									<p>Some of her best friends still live at Irving Street, so Kathy returns for chicken dinners and birthday parties. Living alone has been a major adjustment.</p>
									<p>&ldquo;I really freaked out bad my first night in the apartment,&rdquo; she said. But she sees herself as an example to the women she left behind. &ldquo;It gives them hope for the future. It can be done.&rdquo;</p>

									<p>She tells you she grew up in &ldquo;different parts of towns and countries,&rdquo; in churches and group homes. She says she had no parents. As an adult, she lived in shelters, but one time she had her own apartment and a job cleaning offices. She can&rsquo;t say when that was.</p>
									<p>She recalls coming to Colorado on a bus by herself, maybe from Indiana.</p>
									<p>Marion, 50, spends her days at Irving Street &ldquo;just cleaning my clothes.&rdquo; Sometimes, she goes &ldquo;out walking to see trees and flowers.&rdquo;</p>
									<p>Marion usually sits alone in the living room or on the front porch, not responding if someone says hello to her. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get along with nobody,&rdquo; she says.</p>
									<p>Marion, a stout woman with turquoise sneakers, layers of clothes and a white sun hat, has what therapists call an &ldquo;altered mental state, not otherwise specified.&rdquo; But ask her whether she has any mental health issues and she says, &ldquo;I just have a problem with iron. I take iron pills.&rdquo;</p>

									<p class="lead">She saw shadows coming at her, heard voices telling her what to do.</p>
									<p>Crystal Thomas, 36, describes what happened a few years ago as her &ldquo;mental breakdown,&rdquo; one that rattled her life so much she lost her four children to foster care and was evicted from her apartment.</p>
									<p>She was staying at a friend&rsquo;s home in Colorado Springs when the paranoia began. Crystal felt unsafe and took her children to live on the streets, sleeping in shelters or the Greyhound bus depot.</p>
									<p>They eventually rented a place in Denver&rsquo;s Sun Valley, one of the poorest parts of the city, but were evicted when Crystal and her boyfriend didn&rsquo;t make rent. The children now live with an aunt in Indiana.</p>
									<p>Crystal&rsquo;s boyfriend moved away without her, and she again was homeless, living in shelters and spending a month in Denver Health Medical Center&rsquo;s in-patient psychiatric unit.</p>
									<p>Then she got a call that there was a bed for her at Irving Street, where she has lived for more than two years. She has since been diagnosed with schizophrenia, which she keeps under control with medication.</p>
									<p>&ldquo;When I&rsquo;m off of it, that&rsquo;s when the voices start up,&rdquo; she said.</p>
									<p>Crystal has stayed at Irving Street longer than most residents because it&rsquo;s hard to find an apartment to rent with an eviction and a criminal record.</p>
									<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to leave,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I want to get a place right now, but I know I have to be patient.&rdquo;</p>
									<p>Crystal grew up on the Gila River Indian Community in Arizona. She never knew her father, and her mother died when she was 1. She bounced from state to state, staying with relatives and friends, for much of her life.</p>
									<p>She is hopeful that she will change her life&rsquo;s course, that she will manage her mental illness, act financially responsible and have her children returned to her.</p>
									<p>&ldquo;I feel like I was blessed being so fortunate to come to this place,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really been like home to me. I feel like they got my back.&rdquo;</p>

									<p class="lead">Her childhood was full of nightmares.</p>
									<p>Sandra Castillo, 43,was assaulted by more than one of her mother&rsquo;s boyfriends while her mom was passed out drunk. Then her mother dropped her off at a friend&rsquo;s house and promised to pick her up the next morning &mdash; except she didn&rsquo;t come back for six months. By then, Sandra had been given to foster care.</p>
									<p>Sandra ran away at 14 and found her mother. At 15, she and her mom were bar-hopping in Mexico, where Sandra met a musician, got married and had her first baby at 16.</p>
									<p>There began a string of abusive relationships.</p>
									<p>As long as she can remember, Sandra had panic attacks &mdash; her heart would race and her breath shorten. She worried someone was chasing her.</p>
									<p>She lost several jobs and then lost her house after her two children had grown up and moved out. She spent months living in homeless shelters around Colorado.</p>
									<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until she saw a therapist four years ago while living in a Boulder shelter that she learned why she had panic attacks. Sandra was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, a result of her damaging childhood, as well as depression and bipolar disorder.</p>
									<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a very lonely life,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m learning to understand myself and who I am. I&rsquo;m learning how to cope with everything being here.</p>
									<p>&ldquo;This past five years, I&rsquo;ve started over I don&rsquo;t know how many times.&rdquo;</p>
									<p>Sandra said she constantly battles a feeling of fear and dread, thinking another bad thing is just around the corner. &ldquo;Some days when I&rsquo;m here, I feel stuck,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Some days there are pretty bad breakdowns where everything just seems sad.&rdquo;</p>
									<p>After a year at Irving Street, Sandra still finds it hard to relax, to shake the feeling that she will have to leave at any moment. But she is trying.</p>
									<p>&ldquo;I feel like I belong somewhere finally, with people who understand,&rdquo; she said.</p>

									<p class="lead">She was holding on, a single mom with two kids and a job at the Division of Youth Corrections.</p>
									<p>&ldquo;Then it was like it all went to hell,&rdquo; said Tara Lea Chamblin, recalling the year when depression took over and her life fell apart.</p>
									<p>She was drinking too much, using marijuana and cocaine to try to make herself feel better. She had thoughts of leaving her car running in the garage as she and her kids sat inside and &ldquo;just went to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
									<p>At work, she was receiving &ldquo;corrective actions,&rdquo; and she felt like she was &ldquo;weighted down by a ton of bricks.&rdquo; She quit, then called her sister and said, &ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m drowning.&rdquo;</p>
									<p>Tara&rsquo;s son and daughter stayed with their aunt while Tara checked into Denver Health Medical Center, where she was medicated for anxiety, sleep problems and borderline personality disorder.</p>
									<p>Tara, who wears silver rings and a pink handkerchief around her dark-brown hair, talks so fast that sometimes she sounds breathless. She says her moods go up and down like a &ldquo;highway-to-hell roller coaster.&rdquo;</p>
									<p>&ldquo;You can be the life of the party, thinking, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m Jesus. I can change this.&rsquo; And then I&rsquo;m sunk.&rdquo;</p>
									<p>After she left Denver Health, Tara lived with a boyfriend for a while, then became homeless and floated among cheap motels. She was homeless when her mother killed herself at home in Monte Vista during an argument with her father. &ldquo;I think everybody has a breaking point, and my mom just met hers. I&rsquo;ve had situations like that, when you&rsquo;re sick of it all. I understand.&rdquo;</p>
									<p>Tara didn&rsquo;t know how to save herself.</p>
									<p>&ldquo;What if you ain&rsquo;t got no bootstraps? What if someone doesn&rsquo;t know how to pull themselves out of a black hole?&rdquo;</p>
									<p>Then she visited a mental health clinic and lucked into a bed at Irving Street. After two weeks in the women&rsquo;s home, she felt like she was living in a &ldquo;castle.&rdquo; She is grateful for the respite, wants to regain her life and repair her relationship with her teenage children.</p>
									<p>&ldquo;I was good, and then I got lost for two years and now I&rsquo;m back,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m who I am in my heart.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>At 3, Joshua Plunkett hallucinated about dog-headed men trying to attack and giant snakes about to swallow him. His mind, even then, brought him auditory hallucinations that would terrify an adult, let alone a preschooler. The &ldquo;kids&rdquo; in his head once told him to kill himself by jumping off the balcony.</p>
		<p>His parents were there to stop him.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;I was in another mind,&rdquo; Joshua, now 17, <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="startVideo" id="hilite7" onclick="playerScroller('video22', 's4a2JlcTplvUvMUJR4qTRzpNhqQqXOG_', this);">explained recently</a>.</p>
		<p>Joshua&rsquo;s mind has been different since he was born. He is one of the 13 percent of children who have serious mental illness, and an example of how early treatment can curb the impact of mental problems in school and growing up.</p>
		<p>Early treatment is key to improving mental illness, yet kids younger than 6 are the age group least likely to receive mental health care if they need it. About half of adults with mental illness had problems as children, and three-quarters of adults with mental illness had symptoms by age 22.</p>
		<p>A national study on adverse childhood experiences found that people who experienced childhood trauma &mdash; whether because of abuse, a one-time traumatic event or even divorce &mdash; were more likely to have mental illnesses as adults. For others, it&rsquo;s hereditary.</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">More kids, shorter stays</h3>

		<p class="lead">The emergency room at Children&rsquo;s Hospital Colorado has seen 10 to 30 percent increases year after year in the number of children arriving in mental health crisis &mdash; reaching 3,100 kids last year.</p>
		<p>In 2014, the hospital is on pace to see more than 3,800 children in mental health crisis at the emergency department. Most of them are suicidal or aggressive and threatening to hurt someone else.</p>
		<p>About half of the children end up needing hospitalization, said Dr. Douglas Novins, chair of the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Children&rsquo;s.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We are really in a behavioral health crisis in our state,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The number of children who are coming here in behavioral health crisis has really increased enormously.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The hospital has 18 psychiatric overnight beds, plus others for patients with autism or eating disorders, and they are almost always full. Children&rsquo;s sends kids who need hospitalization to other in-patient centers or hospitals when its psychiatric unit is full or the family&rsquo;s insurance wants the child to go somewhere less expensive.</p>
		<p>Behind the locked doors of the children&rsquo;s psych unit, the walls are a friendly turquoise and purple. The individual rooms have twin beds, private bathrooms, plastic chairs made heavy with sand, and electronic window shades sealed between panes of glass.</p>
		<p>First names are written on the outside of children&rsquo;s doors, and the stuffed animals they brought from home sit on their beds. There is also a gym, and rooms for yoga, dance and music therapies.</p>
		<p>Two decades ago, the average length of stay for children in psychiatric hospitals was a month. Today, it is nine days, with a goal of treating children in the least-restrictive environment possible.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Often the pressure for the shorter length of stay is from the insurance companies,&rdquo; said Jim Myers, administrator of Children&rsquo;s pediatric mental health institute.</p>
		<p>Families can visit each day but must leave anything considered remotely dangerous &mdash; keys, nail files, cellphones and paper clips &mdash; in lockers outside the unit.</p>
		<p>About 5 percent of children will experience a mental health crisis likely to require hospitalization. In Colorado, an estimated 89,000 children and teens are dealing with serious emotional disturbances, some of them so severe they cannot live with their families.</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">&ldquo;Something was different&rdquo;</h3>

		<p class="lead">Joshua has been in mental health treatment since age 4, including a week-long stay at Children&rsquo;s Hospital after a first psychotic episode that lasted two days and had him pulling his hair out. He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at age 5 and autism at 7.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;From the beginning, we pretty much knew something was different,&rdquo; Brenda said.</p>
		<p>As an infant, Joshua was inconsolable much of the time. He wouldn&rsquo;t sleep. Wouldn&rsquo;t take a pacifier. His grandmother had to come over to their house and hold him just so Brenda could take a shower.</p>
		<p>It didn&rsquo;t get easier.</p>
		<p>Joshua was kicked out of two preschools for attacking other children. He &ldquo;bombed out&rdquo; of elementary school and spent a couple years at a state-funded day-treatment center, where he felt like he wasn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;weird alien outcast&rdquo; for the first time in his life, and a year home-schooling.</p>
		<p>Through a combination of medication and therapy, Joshua was ready to rejoin public school in seventh grade. Usually, he can contain his outbursts and emotional mood swings by &ldquo;holding it in&rdquo; until he gets home for the day, he said.</p>

		<p>Even at 17, the Horizon High School junior still doesn&rsquo;t like touching animals or people. Or loud noises. Or almost any food that is not noodles or fried chicken or microwavable chimichangas. Or getting on anything with wheels, including bikes, scooters and skateboards. He definitely does not like change.</p>
		<p>A school picnic in the park had him concerned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to handle that really well,&rdquo; he said.</p>
		<p>Joshua is polite and loves to talk about music, especially rap.</p>
		<p>He realizes he has different obstacles than his classmates. They are talking about college; he is learning from his occupational therapist at Community Reach Center how to deal with the noises and smells of the crowded city bus, shop for groceries and cook his own dinner.</p>
		<p>Joshua is in special-needs classes in high school and avoids the lunch crowd by eating with teachers and a few other students in a separate room. He finds it especially difficult when he is studying &ldquo;depressing things.&rdquo; A book about the Holocaust in English class and a video about Hurricane Katrina devastate him for days.</p>
		<p>Advocating for Joshua has taken up much of his mother&rsquo;s life.</p>
		<p>School meetings about his behavior, where Brenda Ralph was once the lone outsider, now include a panel of advocates she brings with her into the room. She fought for special-needs classes, and she drives Joshua to weekly occupational therapy and psychiatric appointments.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t have a job because of all the appointments he has; this is why I&rsquo;m a stay-at-home mom,&rdquo; she said.</p>
		<p>One week each summer, Brenda and her husband, Jason, get a break, and Joshua hangs out with other autistic children at an Easter Seals camp in Empire.</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">Childhood trauma&rsquo;s impact</h3>

		<p class="lead">Many mental illnesses, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, are linked to genetics and environmental factors. What happens in childhood has a startling correlation with mental illness later in life.</p>
		<p>Researchers have used Kaiser Permanente data gleaned from the questionnaires of thousands of patients who were asked about their childhoods, including whether their parents used drugs, were abusive, had mental illness, were imprisoned, divorced, died or committed domestic violence.</p>
		<p>The more childhood traumas, the more likely adults are to have clinical depression and hallucinations. One study found that people with seven or more negative childhood experiences were five times more likely to have hallucinations.</p>
		<p>Take, for example, William Gregor, who hasn&rsquo;t belonged to anyone since he was 4.</p>
		<p>That&rsquo;s when he was taken from his family and put in foster care, except he didn&rsquo;t live with foster families &mdash; he grew up in institutions, group homes and a boys ranch for kids with serious mental illnesses.</p>
		<p>The list of prescription drugs he was given is long: Thorazine, Zyprexa, Lithium, Seroquel, Risperdal, Trazodone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done it all,&rdquo; said Gregor, 39.</p>
		<p>He has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia.</p>
		<p>Now, he is a heroin addict. Gregor panhandles near 16th Street Mall in downtown Denver until he gets $100, enough for 1 gram in the morning and another at night.</p>
		<p>Without the heroin, he knows of only one other way to deal with the voices in his head.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I beat my head against a wall. I punch myself,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo; I go into a dark place in my mind. I start hearing and seeing things. You got to beat your head to make it stop.&rdquo;</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">Evolving science</h3>

		<p class="lead">Diagnosis of mental illness in children has advanced significantly in the last 20 years, but what is lacking is &ldquo;knowing what works and what helps,&rdquo; said Lydia Prado, head of child and family services at the Mental Health Center of Denver.</p>
		<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until the late 1980s that the medical world definitively acknowledged children could get depressed. Prior thinking was that children had not developed enough emotionally to suffer depression. The field of children&rsquo;s psychiatry has evolved to recognize that depression looks different in children than it does in adults.</p>
		<p>Even babies can become depressed, said Dr. Shannon Bekman, program manager for the infant mental health program at the Mental Health Center of Denver.</p>
		<p>Babies are supposed to cry. It&rsquo;s when they stop crying &mdash; often because of neglect &mdash; that they are considered clinically depressed.</p>
		<p>Scientists have found that a huge portion of brain development happens in the first three years of life, so treatment then has lifelong impact, Bekman said. Therapy for depressed babies focuses on strengthening the parent-childhood relationship.</p>
		<p>Some children develop a mental illness because of a one-time traumatic experience such as a car accident. One child treated at the Mental Health Center of Denver was riding in a Toyota Prius that was struck head-on by a tractor-trailer rig. The preschooler became withdrawn, regressed in toilet training, and refused to set foot in a vehicle. He was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>
		<p>Another child would break down when it was time to clean up. It turned out that a caregiver had been telling the 4-year-old a goblin would get her if she was bad.</p>
		<p>The symptoms of mental illness in younger children typically are setbacks in language or developmental skills, including walking or crawling. Mental illness in school-age children often looks like anger and aggression, although girls are more likely to internalize it and appear sad and shy.</p>
		<p>The Mental Health Center of Denver has therapists in several Denver schools and public health clinics so that kids can get psychiatric care at the same place they see pediatricians. The center also sends therapists to day-care centers and runs a day-treatment program for kids whose mental illness is so severe that it keeps them from functioning in regular classrooms.</p>
		<p>Denver Public Schools has infused its mental health services with $4.5 million in additional spending spread over three years, on top of the $12.2 million annual budget for psychological and social work. Every school in the district has either a psychologist, social worker or both, and mental health staff has increased 30 percent in five years.</p>
		<p>The boost in services targeted neighborhoods where children have suffered the most trauma and are more likely to have emotional problems at school, said Eldridge Greer, director of social emotional learning for Denver schools.</p>
		<p>At 15 school-based clinics last year, more than 1,500 Denver students received 12,000 mental health therapy sessions.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t look at it through the mental health lens, it may be seen as a discipline problem,&rdquo; Greer said. &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t address mental health, we are not going to get the results we want in academics.&rdquo;</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">Anger management</h3>

		<p class="lead">This is how Chazz Worrell, 10, explains his depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress and intermittent explosive disorder:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;When people be mean to me, it makes me get really angry, so I have to let it all out somewhere,&rdquo; he said. He feels like he wants to hit somebody. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t do that. What I do is hit wood. It helps keep the pressure on the inside instead of letting it all out on other people.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>He chops wood, builds fences, moves horses and bottle-feeds the calves at his older brother&rsquo;s small ranch in Fort Collins.</p>

		</div>
		<p>The fourth-grader spends time at the ranch almost daily, and his mother says it helps him more than any other therapy. Without some release, his emotional outbursts are volatile.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;He can hit things, throw things, try to break things or even hit himself,&rdquo; Liz Worrell said. The anger gives way to sadness, especially if he hurt someone or broke something. He begins to yell, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m stupid! I shouldn&rsquo;t be here.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Chazz&rsquo;s anxiety has him constantly worried in public that he will get lost and never see his parents again. They are buying walkie-talkies. His post-traumatic stress developed after his grandmother passed away in front of him.</p>

		<p>Liz has been through this before, with her now-23-year-old son, and this time, she is much more equipped to handle the school meetings that felt, the first time around, like board rooms where she was on trial for her parenting skills. Now, she brings Chazz&rsquo;s advocate from a community mental health clinic.</p>
		<p>By now, she also has shunned medication, tired of seeing her older son playing the &ldquo;guinea pig&rdquo; as doctors adjusted medications that made him sit around all day like a zombie. Instead, she gives Chazz a quiet room, with his dog, to calm down. Afterward, they talk about how he could have handled his outburst another way.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;By the time they are done here, they are worn out. The best therapy I can give them is this,&rdquo; said Liz, surrounded by calves, alpacas and horses.</p>

		<p class="lead">The clicking shut of the door to the children&rsquo;s psychiatric unit can devastate Amy Walker in an instant.</p>
		<p>Two years ago, cuts and bite marks up and down her arms, she drove her 10-year-old son to the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Colorado emergency department from Pueblo to ask for help.</p>

		<p>Grant&rsquo;s first stay in the psychiatric unit lasted eight weeks. His parents were allowed to visit him just two hours per day.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;There is something about that door,&rdquo; Amy said, choking out the words and unable to stop the tears. &ldquo;You are leaving your child on a locked unit with strangers. He doesn&rsquo;t understand what&rsquo;s going on.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>A hospital staff member held her as she cried after the door shut. &ldquo;I remember just crying and crying and feeling such a loss and also kind of knowing that we were going to deal with this the rest of our lives, him being hospitalized,&rdquo; she said.</p>
		<p>Grant, now 12, has been hospitalized three times for treatment of his severe autism and mood disorder. The hospital rooftops are littered with things he has thrown out the windows &mdash; socks, shoes, folders. He has broken multiple iPads, including one that went down a hospital elevator shaft.</p>
		<p>His mood swings, similar to bipolar disorder, rise and fall and intermingle with his cognitive delays. Grant can&rsquo;t write his name and talks in short sentences, like a little kid. He repeats things.</p>
		<p>The Walkers knew deep down something was wrong with their second son when he was a toddler, but they weren&rsquo;t ready to hear it.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s kind of a process, a process of accepting it,&rdquo; Amy said.</p>
		<p>In kindergarten and first grade, Grant terrorized his class, turning on and off the lights, throwing things, screaming. Then he began going to school in his own classroom with one-on-one instruction.</p>
		<p>The other mothers were cruel, talking about him behind Amy&rsquo;s back.</p>
		<p>Overnight psychiatric treatment at Children&rsquo;s changed their lives, the Walkers said.</p>
		<p>Grant was watched 24 hours a day as staffers, every 15 minutes, documented what he was doing. A psychiatrist and psychologist analyzed the log and were able to figure out what set him off and how to calm him down.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;When someone else is tucking your baby in it at night, there is just this level of trust,&rdquo; Amy said. &ldquo;We love these people. They have saved our family.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Still, the sound of the locking door hasn&rsquo;t gotten any easier for her to hear.</p>
